As a primary language, it outperformed Java and has closed the gap with JavaScript.\\nAccording to the community,\\nAI/ML\\nis the most promising technology, and\\nRust\\nis the most promising programming language.\\nOne out of every two developers is planning to adopt a new language. The top choices for next languages are\\nGo, Rust, Kotlin, TypeScript, and Python.\\nThe most widespread programming language in the world is\\nJavaScript.\\nTypeScript\\nis the fastest-growing programming language.\\nThe most favorite programming languages are\\nKotlin, C#, Python, Rust, and Java.\\nThe least favorite programming languages are\\nPerl, Visual Basic, Delphi, and C.\\nProgramming languages\\nHalf of all developers surveyed are planning to adopt a new programming language. The two most popular choices for next languages are Go and Rust, followed by Kotlin, TypeScript, and Python.\\nWhich programming languages have you used in the last 12 months?\\nIn 2021, the survey attracted a disproportionately high share of PHP and Laravel developers. You can find more information about the reasons for this aberration in the\\nMethodology\\nsection.\\nThe programming languages that are showing a downward trend include PHP, Ruby, Objective-C, and Scala.\\nWhich programming languages have you used in the last 12 months?\\nThe most popular programming language, JavaScript, is used by 65% of developers in one way or another. It is also the most popular primary language, with a share of 34%.\\nTypeScript’s share has almost tripled over the course of 6 years, increasing from 12% in 2017 to 34% in 2022.\\nWill it eventually replace JavaScript? Though it is rapidly catching up to JavaScript, the usage of JavaScript remains stable high. 92% of TypeScript developers use JavaScript, with 40% choosing it as one of their primary languages.\\nWhat are your primary programming languages?\\nChoose no more than three languages.\\nPython has been growing in popularity, and with a share of 55%, it is now the second most used language, after JavaScript. More than half of all developers in the world are using it.\\nPython is also growing as a primary programming language and is catching up to JavaScript. Only one percentage point separates them, with Python at 33% and JavaScript at 34%!\\nFavorite programming language\\nMentioned most often\\nRelative to the number of users\\nThe five most favorite programming languages are Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Kotlin!\\nWhen we consider these preferences relative to number of people using the languages, however, the leaders are Kotlin, C#, Python, Rust, Java.\\nLeast favorite programming language\\nMentioned most often\\nRelative to the number of users\\nThe five most disliked programming languages are JavaScript, Java, PHP, C and C++.\\nJavaScript and Java are very controversial, as they are on top of the lists for both favorite and least favorite languages.\\nBut if we calculate the least favorite language relative to the number of people using it, there is an absolute champion as the most dreaded language. Perl’s share is a whopping 96%, followed by Visual Basic with 77%, Delphi with 60%, and C with 51%.\\nPrimary programming languages by age\\nThe languages with the highest share among the youngest respondents (18–20) are Assembly, C, C++, Haskell, Lua, MatLab, and Rust. This is perhaps unsurprising, as these languages are often taught in universities.\\nThe languages with relatively high shares among older developers are COBOL, Assembly, CoffeeScript, Perl, Delphi, and Visual Basic. With the exception of Assembly, these languages have low shares among developers younger than 30.\\nThere is also a low amount of interest in Ruby among young developers.\\nTypes of development\\nIn which kinds of activities are you involved?\\nFor which platforms do you develop?\\nWhich platforms do you target with your projects?\\nThis question was only shown to respondents who develop for desktop.\\nWhat types of software do you develop?\\nThe youngest survey respondents primarily work on game development and entertainment software.\\nWhat types of software do you develop with your main languages?\\nThis year, we asked respondents to match their primary programming language with the software types and platforms they use it for. This provided a more accurate picture of the most popular use cases for various languages than last year’s report, where we just made a cross table with the three primary programming languages.\\nPlatforms by language\\nTechnologies\\nWhich technologies do you find promising?\\nBased on answers to a free-response question.\\n* No specific technology was mentioned.\\nThe largest share of developers identified AI / ML as the most promising technology. In addition to programming languages, respondents also mentioned Blockchain, WebAssembly, Flutter, AR / VR, and Cloud technologies.\\nOn which operating systems are your development environments?\\nDo you use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for local development?\\nThis question was shown to all respondents who use Windows as their operating system.\\nWhich devices do you use for development?\\nThe responses indicate that developers appreciate mobility. 85% of developers use laptops for coding, and 39% use laptops and desktops simultaneously.\\n9% of the respondents claimed to code with a smartphone, with 65% of them developing for mobile!\\nWhat kinds of plugins do you install with your IDE or editor?\\nMore than a half of developers (55%) install UI themes and add-ons for their IDEs or editors.\\nSalary\\nWhat is your annual net (after tax) salary in USD, excluding any bonuses?\\nHow satisfied are you with your salary?\\n57%\\nof developers are satisfied with their salary to some extent.\\nSalary satisfaction by annual net (after tax) salary in USD\\nMedian value of annual net (after tax) salary in USD, excluding any bonuses\\nBy regions\\nShare of top-paid employees by job role\\nTop-paid employees are considered to be those whose salary belongs to the top 25% highest salaries among respondents in their country.\\nShare of top-paid employees by primary language\\nGender and development\\nGender\\nIn charts below the “Other” option includes “non-binary, “genderqueer, or gender non-conforming”, as well as the “Other, please specify” and “Prefer not to say” options.  The sample size of this group is too small, however, for reliable conclusions to be drawn from it.\\nGender distribution by region\\nSouth Korea and Argentina had the largest shares of women.\\nThe types of software development with the largest shares of women are augmented reality / virtual reality, websites, and business intelligence / data science / machine learning.\\nProfessional coding experience by gender\\nThough diversity remains low in the tech industry, it is trending upwards.\\nGender by age\\nPrimary languages by gender\\nMigration\\nWere you born in the country / region where you currently live?\\nAbout 10% of developers have moved to live in another country.\\nWhich year did you start living in the country/region you currently live?\\nWe see that migration among developers has generally been increasing, especially since 2015. It dropped in 2020 presumably due to the pandemic, and in 2022 it recovered to the levels seen in 2019.\\nEmigration\\nEmigration rate\\n= The number of people who were born in one country or region but work in a different one / the total number of people born in the country or region of origin.\\nImmigration\\nImmigration rate\\n= The number of people working in a country or region who were born in a different region / the total number of people working in the destination country or region.\\nLanguages\\nWhich language do you mainly use at work?\\nThis question was only shown to respondents who use different languages at home and at work.\\nTeam Leads and Senior Developers are more likely to use English at work while speaking other languages at home or with friends.\\nDo you speak at home or with friends in the same language as you use at work?\\nWhat languages do you use with family and friends?\\nThis question was only shown to respondents who use different languages at home and at work.\\nOut of that 13% who do not speak the same language at home as they do with their colleagues, the three languages most commonly spoken with family and friends were English, Chinese, and Hindi.\\nCheck out the other\\nlarge-scale survey reports by JetBrains\\n.\\nNext\\nLifestyle and Fun\\nKey Takeaways\\n:\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n2017\\nKey Takeaways\\nLifestyle and Fun\\nDemographics\\nMethodology\\nC\\nC#\\nC++\\nGo\\nJava\\nJavaScript\\nKotlin\\nPHP\\nPython\\nR\\nRuby\\nRust\\nScala\\nSwift and Objective-C\\nBig Data\\nDatabases\\nData Science\\nDevOps and Cloud\\nEducation\\nEmbedded\\nMicroservices\\nMiscellaneous Tech\\nMental Well-Being\\nRemote Dev\\nTeam Tools\\nTech Writing\\nTesting\\nFind the right tool\\nSee all tools\\nJavaScript\\n.NET\\nJava\\nKotlin\\nC/C++\\nPython\\nPHP\\nRuby\\nGo\\nSQL\\nTeam Tools\\nThank you for your time!\\nWe hope you found our report useful.

The two most popular choices for next languages are Go and Rust, followed by Kotlin, TypeScript, and Python.\\nWhich programming languages have you used in the last 12 months?\\nIn 2021, the survey attracted a disproportionately high share of PHP and Laravel developers. You can find more information about the reasons for this aberration in the\\nMethodology\\nsection.\\nThe programming languages that are showing a downward trend include PHP, Ruby, Objective-C, and Scala.\\nWhich programming languages have you used in the last 12 months?\\nThe most popular programming language, JavaScript, is used by 65% of developers in one way or another. It is also the most popular primary language, with a share of 34%.\\nTypeScript’s share has almost tripled over the course of 6 years, increasing from 12% in 2017 to 34% in 2022.\\nWill it eventually replace JavaScript? Though it is rapidly catching up to JavaScript, the usage of JavaScript remains stable high. 92% of TypeScript developers use JavaScript, with 40% choosing it as one of their primary languages.\\nWhat are your primary programming languages?\\nChoose no more than three languages.\\nPython has been growing in popularity, and with a share of 55%, it is now the second most used language, after JavaScript. More than half of all developers in the world are using it.\\nPython is also growing as a primary programming language and is catching up to JavaScript. Only one percentage point separates them, with Python at 33% and JavaScript at 34%!\\nFavorite programming language\\nMentioned most often\\nRelative to the number of users\\nThe five most favorite programming languages are Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Kotlin!\\nWhen we consider these preferences relative to number of people using the languages, however, the leaders are Kotlin, C#, Python, Rust, Java.\\nLeast favorite programming language\\nMentioned most often\\nRelative to the number of users\\nThe five most disliked programming languages are JavaScript, Java, PHP, C and C++.\\nJavaScript and Java are very controversial, as they are on top of the lists for both favorite and least favorite languages.\\nBut if we calculate the least favorite language relative to the number of people using it, there is an absolute champion as the most dreaded language. Perl’s share is a whopping 96%, followed by Visual Basic with 77%, Delphi with 60%, and C with 51%.\\nPrimary programming languages by age\\nThe languages with the highest share among the youngest respondents (18–20) are Assembly, C, C++, Haskell, Lua, MatLab, and Rust. This is perhaps unsurprising, as these languages are often taught in universities.\\nThe languages with relatively high shares among older developers are COBOL, Assembly, CoffeeScript, Perl, Delphi, and Visual Basic. With the exception of Assembly, these languages have low shares among developers younger than 30.\\nThere is also a low amount of interest in Ruby among young developers.\\nTypes of development\\nIn which kinds of activities are you involved?\\nFor which platforms do you develop?\\nWhich platforms do you target with your projects?\\nThis question was only shown to respondents who develop for desktop.\\nWhat types of software do you develop?\\nThe youngest survey respondents primarily work on game development and entertainment software.\\nWhat types of software do you develop with your main languages?\\nThis year, we asked respondents to match their primary programming language with the software types and platforms they use it for. This provided a more accurate picture of the most popular use cases for various languages than last year’s report, where we just made a cross table with the three primary programming languages.\\nPlatforms by language\\nTechnologies\\nWhich technologies do you find promising?\\nBased on answers to a free-response question.\\n* No specific technology was mentioned.\\nThe largest share of developers identified AI / ML as the most promising technology. In addition to programming languages, respondents also mentioned Blockchain, WebAssembly, Flutter, AR / VR, and Cloud technologies.\\nOn which operating systems are your development environments?\\nDo you use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for local development?\\nThis question was shown to all respondents who use Windows as their operating system.\\nWhich devices do you use for development?\\nThe responses indicate that developers appreciate mobility. 85% of developers use laptops for coding, and 39% use laptops and desktops simultaneously.\\n9% of the respondents claimed to code with a smartphone, with 65% of them developing for mobile!\\nWhat kinds of plugins do you install with your IDE or editor?\\nMore than a half of developers (55%) install UI themes and add-ons for their IDEs or editors.\\nSalary\\nWhat is your annual net (after tax) salary in USD, excluding any bonuses?\\nHow satisfied are you with your salary?\\n57%\\nof developers are satisfied with their salary to some extent.\\nSalary satisfaction by annual net (after tax) salary in USD\\nMedian value of annual net (after tax) salary in USD, excluding any bonuses\\nBy regions\\nShare of top-paid employees by job role\\nTop-paid employees are considered to be those whose salary belongs to the top 25% highest salaries among respondents in their country.\\nShare of top-paid employees by primary language\\nGender and development\\nGender\\nIn charts below the “Other” option includes “non-binary, “genderqueer, or gender non-conforming”, as well as the “Other, please specify” and “Prefer not to say” options.  The sample size of this group is too small, however, for reliable conclusions to be drawn from it.\\nGender distribution by region\\nSouth Korea and Argentina had the largest shares of women.\\nThe types of software development with the largest shares of women are augmented reality / virtual reality, websites, and business intelligence / data science / machine learning.\\nProfessional coding experience by gender\\nThough diversity remains low in the tech industry, it is trending upwards.\\nGender by age\\nPrimary languages by gender\\nMigration\\nWere you born in the country / region where you currently live?\\nAbout 10% of developers have moved to live in another country.\\nWhich year did you start living in the country/region you currently live?\\nWe see that migration among developers has generally been increasing, especially since 2015. It dropped in 2020 presumably due to the pandemic, and in 2022 it recovered to the levels seen in 2019.\\nEmigration\\nEmigration rate\\n= The number of people who were born in one country or region but work in a different one / the total number of people born in the country or region of origin.\\nImmigration\\nImmigration rate\\n= The number of people working in a country or region who were born in a different region / the total number of people working in the destination country or region.\\nLanguages\\nWhich language do you mainly use at work?\\nThis question was only shown to respondents who use different languages at home and at work.\\nTeam Leads and Senior Developers are more likely to use English at work while speaking other languages at home or with friends.\\nDo you speak at home or with friends in the same language as you use at work?\\nWhat languages do you use with family and friends?\\nThis question was only shown to respondents who use different languages at home and at work.\\nOut of that 13% who do not speak the same language at home as they do with their colleagues, the three languages most commonly spoken with family and friends were English, Chinese, and Hindi.\\nCheck out the other\\nlarge-scale survey reports by JetBrains\\n.\\nNext\\nLifestyle and Fun\\nKey Takeaways\\n:\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n2017\\nKey Takeaways\\nLifestyle and Fun\\nDemographics\\nMethodology\\nC\\nC#\\nC++\\nGo\\nJava\\nJavaScript\\nKotlin\\nPHP\\nPython\\nR\\nRuby\\nRust\\nScala\\nSwift and Objective-C\\nBig Data\\nDatabases\\nData Science\\nDevOps and Cloud\\nEducation\\nEmbedded\\nMicroservices\\nMiscellaneous Tech\\nMental Well-Being\\nRemote Dev\\nTeam Tools\\nTech Writing\\nTesting\\nFind the right tool\\nSee all tools\\nJavaScript\\n.NET\\nJava\\nKotlin\\nC/C++\\nPython\\nPHP\\nRuby\\nGo\\nSQL\\nTeam Tools\\nThank you for your time!\\nWe hope you found our report useful.

There are a lot of situations where people expect to be approached, and if you can find an easier target to ask directions (for example), go for them instead. You\\'re better off going for someone in a ticket office in a metro station as opposed to the person rushing by in a suit with a briefcase, on a phone. You want life to be easy, right?8. Pay attention to visual cuesThis does relate to body language somewhat, but is important enough to warrant its own [...] I also want to let you know that it\\'s always worth trying to communicate, because your experiences of trying to make yourself understood are extremely valuable. Here are\\xa010 easy tips for overcoming language barriers while traveling.\\n\\n10 tips for overcoming language barriers\\n\\n1. Focus on your body language\\n\\n2. Make friends\\n\\n3. Take notes\\n\\n4. Keep a positive mindset\\n\\n5. Participate in language exchanges\\n\\n6. Adopt a \\'learn it before you need it\\' mentality\\n\\n7. Strategize [...] 8.

Things will happen and change, and it’s essential to keep that in mind. If you’re trying to speak to someone and it\\'s not going particularly well, try different ways of getting your point across. Use a combination of the methods above and if it still isn’t happening, it\\'s okay to politely say thank you and try someone else.\\n\\nFall in love with someone who speaks a foreign language [...] Further to the previous point, kindness and politeness are essential in all parts of life but are especially crucial when navigating language barriers. Fair enough, it can get frustrating if you’ve been trying for some time and the message is still unclear — but that’s no excuse to be rude! People will be happy to help if you are friendly. If people can see you’re struggling, often others will step in and help.\\n\\nKeep it simple and ditch the slang [...] Don’t let it! Navigating a new language is a massive part of the travel experience, and a great way to fully immerse yourself in the place you’re visiting. Besides, the worst that can happen is that you’ll get a funny “lost in translation” story to tell.\\n\\nWith that in mind, we’ve rounded up some tips for overcoming language barriers so that you can feel comfortable and get the most out of your trip.\\n\\nContents\\n\\nLearn (at least) the basics\\n</Document>'], 'docs': []}, next=('docs_loader',), config={'configurable': {'thread_id': 68, 'checkpoint_ns': 'perform_web_search:3bc33035-58e4-5307-3196-45d4a465c316', 'checkpoint_id': '1f01908c-ae63-6a8b-8002-a489f47b7eee', 'checkpoint_map': {'': '1f01908c-3900-6e98-8002-3f50a0b3c4e5', 'perform_web_search:3bc33035-58e4-5307-3196-45d4a465c316': '1f01908c-ae63-6a8b-8002-a489f47b7eee'}}}, metadata={'source': 'loop', 'writes': {'appraise_results': {'qualifying_links': [QualifyingLink(url='https://www.reddit.com/r/crete/comments/16mt1vq/im_staying_for_3_days_in_crete_what_are_absolute/', status='approve', reason='The document provides recommendations for historical sites and natural beauty spots in Crete, which are relevant to planning a trip.'), QualifyingLink(url='https://rtwin30days.com/crete-greece-5-perfect-days/', status='approve', reason='The document provides insights into different types of attractions and areas in Crete, including historical sites like Knossos, which can help answer questions about must-visit cultural sites and planning a trip to Crete.'), QualifyingLink(url='https://www.rental-center-crete.com/blog/landmark/', status='drop', reason='The document does not provide detailed information about planning a trip to Crete, historical and cultural sites, lesser-known attractions, or transportation tips.

However, there are lesser-known Greek dishes that are equally, if not more, delicious. And Crete is full of them!\\nSome consider the Cretan Diet even healthier than the Mediterranean diet. It includes the exclusive use of extra virgin olive oil, lots of fruits and seasonal vegetables, pulses, cereals, and just a little meat.\\nThe way locals cook on the island relies almost exclusively on local products and can be traced back to ancient times. Minoans knew and used olive oil and local wine like Cretans do in modern times.\\nHowever, several years of Turkish occupation also influenced the local cuisine. Many dishes can often be found (with quite similar names) in Turkish cuisine, starting with the simplest of all: coffee!\\nCretan traditions.\\nWhat Ingredients Will I Find in Cretan Dishes?\\nAre you eager to know more about the foods of Crete? These are some of the ingredients you can expect to find in the local cuisine.\\nVegetables\\nVegans and vegetarians will find paradise on Crete! There are so many dishes that include only vegetables that you’d be surprised. Many locals observe different fasting periods throughout the year, respecting the tradition of the Orthodox Church, but this does not mean that they eat boring salads or plain boiled veggies.\\nThe selection of vegetarian dishes is impressive. Besides, when the island was under Turkish occupation, meat was an expensive ingredient. Cretans survived cultivating their land; their diet has long been largely based on greens, vegetables, and fruits!\\nOther than the overwhelming variety of wild greens, the island is known for oranges, lemons, olives, pears, potatoes, and apples in the\\nLasithi Plateau\\n.\\nOn the southern coast, there are extensive plantations of tomatoes, avocados, kiwis, and bananas. Do try the Cretan banana! It’s smaller, tastier, and stunningly delicious. Traveling around the island, you will be delighted at the sweet smell of fig trees. There’s an incredible variety of grapes, melons, and watermelons, as well as apricots, peaches, and all kinds of nuts.\\nVegetables at the Public Market in Chania.\\nMeat\\nMutton is one of the local favorites. It’s usually served with wild greens or salads, stewed onions, or baked potatoes. Pork is also commonly served, and the Cretans love several dishes, including\\napaki\\nand the well-known village sausages.\\nGoat is another staple on the island. It can be cooked on the spit, poached with rice (pilaff), or, for a more sophisticated touch, sprinkled with honey or\\npetimezi\\n(an ancient grape syrup still used on the island).\\nAntikristo (lamb) from Anogia, Rethymnon.\\nFish\\nThe island has a strong mountain character, so many visitors are surprised to find that its staples are more goat than fish and more mutton than octopus—yes, despite being an island!

This is a Cretan sauce (more of a\\nroux\\n), typical of our island’s cuisine, that locals prepare by cooking\\xa0sheep’s milk\\xa0cream over a low flame with\\xa0wheat flour\\xa0or\\xa0starch.\\nStaka is generally eaten warm as a spread. You can dip bread in it, or it can be served over fried potatoes or fried eggs.\\nThe fatty part that separates from the staka during the cooking process forms\\nstakovoutyro\\n, the staka butter, sometimes used in Cretan\\npiláfi\\n, a delicious rice commonly served at weddings. Staka is a staple Cretan dish and a must-try on the island.\\nBread and\\nstaka\\n.\\nThe King of Cretan Food: Olive Oil\\nExtra virgin, fragrant, spicy, walnutty… You can create as many adjectives as you wish to describe the fantastic characteristics of the local olive oil.\\nThe island, Greece’s second olive oil producer, is home to two different olive varieties:\\nkoroneiki\\nand\\ntsounato\\n. These small olives, resistant to Crete’s hot and dry weather, produce some of the top olive oils in the world.\\nTasting Olive Oil in Heraklion.\\n>> Read more about\\nCrete’s Extra Virgin Olive Oil\\n.\\nEating in Crete: Some Traditions to Keep in Mind\\nCretans eat late, at least after 9 p.m., though many sit at the table even later. The same happens for lunch; almost nobody sits at a table before 1, or even 2 p.m. Don’t worry—restaurants are aware that this is not the case in the rest of the world, so you’ll be able to have a dining table ready at 6 or 7 p.m.\\nDon’t be surprised if those sitting beside you still enjoy their cold coffee. Yes, you guessed right, those are most probably Cretans!\\nMany Cretans prefer to have just one main meal per day, at midday, while at night, they tend to dine light, either with a selection of\\nmezedes\\nor with what might have remained from the day’s main meal. This is not the case for everyone, but it’s not uncommon.\\nCretan traditions (Easter grill).\\n>> Read about\\nStreet food in Chania\\n.\\nWhat to Eat: Staple Dishes from Crete\\nWe’re almost there. I know this is the real reason why you opened this article, but I didn’t want to offer a simple list of dishes to try without first introducing you to the basic secrets of Cretan gastronomy.\\nSo now yes, if you want to explore the unique Cretan cuisine and its dishes, here are 20 of the best local specialties.\\nTraditional cooking in Crete.\\nDakos\\nWhen you visit a restaurant or tavern in Crete or anywhere in Greece, you always have the option to start with appetizers until the main dish comes.\\nDakos\\nis one such appetizer, or “\\nmeze\\n” as commonly called in Greek. Although this dish is a salad, it relates very much to a pizza or Italian bruschetta.\\nThis is because there are chopped tomatoes, olives, and crumbled\\nfeta\\nor\\nmizithra\\ncheese on top of a slice of dried bread or barley rusk, locally known as\\npaximadia\\nwhich has been softened with plenty of extra virgin olive oil. In addition, herbs such as oregano and pepper give the plate an extra flavor. All you have to do to enjoy this dish is to order\\nDakos\\nin any restaurant or tavern in Crete.\\nDakos.\\nGamopilafo\\nGamopilafo\\nis a main dish consisting of rice cooked in meat and poultry broth. The name translates to “rice of the wedding”. Traditionally,\\nGamopilafo\\nis the primary dish in every wedding feast in Crete, mostly in west Crete. It became prevalent between the 17th and 19th centuries when owning rice, meat, and poultry came together with social status.\\nHence, the family hosting the feast chose to prepare\\nGamopilafo\\nwhich needed all three of these ingredients. In other words, this Cretan dish was a way to demonstrate the family’s wealth and fertility to the parents-in-law and the local society.\\nGamopilafo: Wedding pilaf with Greek yogurt and meat.\\nCooking gamopilafo at a wedding.\\nAntikristo\\nIf you are a meat lover, you have to try\\nAntikristo\\n. This name does not refer to a specific kind of meat. Rather, it signifies a special cooking method that means “across the fire”. This old technique is popular among the population in the mountain areas of Crete, where lamb breeding is the main source of income.\\nShepherds use this cooking method to prepare their meat. They place the amb on a round metal rail across a large fire, 10 to 20 centimeters away from the flames, and then let the meat get ready. Although this cooking method can take time, the taste is unique and the result is worth waiting for.\\nAntikristo in Therissos, Chania.\\nKleftiko\\nThere has never been such a popular but at the same time mysterious dish as Kleftiko. This is because, historically, you could never really know what\\nKleftiko\\nconsists of. This ambiguity derives from its name and history.\\nKleftiko\\nmeans “stolen”.\\nA few hundred years ago, pirates used to raid Greek villages and use the stolen food to prepare meals on their ships. It was a mix of all the food which the pirates stole. They called it\\nKleftiko\\nand its legacy is still evident today, as you can find the dish in many Cretan restaurants.\\nAlthough there are many versions, the main Cretan variation consists of a meat, vegetables, and potatoes wrapped in parchment paper and slowly cooked in the oven (if wooden oven, even better!)\\nKleftiko.\\nPatsas\\nPatsas\\nis another Cretan and Greek dish with a rich history. It comes from the\\nMelanos Zomos\\n(black soup) of antiquity. Ancient Cretans used to boil animal intestines with hooves to have a quick but energetic dish.This meal was ideal for warfare as the hooves and guts were light enough to carry without weighing the soldiers down.\\nToday,\\nPatsas\\nstill consists of veal hoovers, tripes, and intestines, all boiled together. Old folks on the island eat this soup usually in the morning for breakfast or as an appetizer before the main meal. Because of its high protein value and medicinal effects, you can also use\\nPatsas\\nas an antidote against hangovers. If you are looking for any extra reason to party in Crete, here you are!\\nPatsas.\\nChaniotiko Boureki\\nBoureki\\nis a classic Cretan pie that consists mainly of potatoes and zucchini. Although many restaurants serve it with an outer layer of dough, Chania Boureki, which is considered the traditional version, does not include the dough layer. It is a delicious vegetarian pie that you can eat for breakfast, brunch, or any other quick meal throughout the day.\\nApart from potatoes and zucchini, you will also taste the flavor of mizithra and fresh mint. Of course, olive oil is always present in every pie. This is my absolute favorite dish on the island!\\nAuthentic Chaniotiko Boureki (photo by Anna M. Kambouraki).\\nFried Snails (Kohli Bourbouristi)\\nIf you are looking for something special, fried snails could be an unexpectedly tasty and unique dish. In many parts of Crete, snails are pan-fried in their shells, usually in hefty amounts of olive oil or on a bed of salt. Cooks usually add vinegar and different herbs such as rosemary or parsley to give an extra flavor to the dish.\\nYou can eat the snails with toothpicks to take the meat parts out of the shells. If you are brave enough to do that, of course! Make sure you also order a glass of ouzo or raki if you want to enjoy this delicate dish.\\nKohli Bourbouristi.\\nOctopus with Chopped Pasta (Xtapodi me Makaronia)\\nA popular Cretan meal, usually made during the fasting period before Greek Easter, is the octopus with chopped pasta. It is a dish that you can find in many restaurants and taverns all around Crete.\\nYou do not need to wait to get to Crete to taste that dish. It takes less than an hour to prepare and cook it. All you need is some fresh octopus, onions, olive oil, wine, herbs, chopped pasta, and trimmed tomatoes.\\nYou can boil the octopus and prepare the pasta like you always do. Just remember to use the juice of the octopus to boil the pasta.\\nPasta with octopus.\\nSarikopitakia – Kalitsounia\\nSarikopitakia are small fried cheesy pastries that you can eat during breakfast or any other time as a quick snack. These small pies may also come as a dessert topped with honey and cinnamon in many Cretan restaurants. Or they can also be a savory starter when filled with local greens, cheese, or spinach.\\nIn fact, there are many different versions of kalitsounia or saropitakia, depending on where they’re made. In the Heraklion region, for instance, they can also be made with\\ntsoureki\\ndough (similar to brioche pastry) and filled with myzithra.\\nThe name comes from the Turkish word “\\nSariki\\n” which means\\nturban\\nand explains the spiral shapes of these mini pastries.\\nSariki\\nalso refers to a traditional headdress worn by Cretan men during celebrations. If you happen to find that dessert in a Cretan restaurant, don’t miss the opportunity to order and taste this unique specialty.\\nKalitsounia with greens.\\nKalitsounia from Therisos (Chania)\\nKalitsounia from Anogia (Rethymnon).\\nKalitsounia from Malevizi (Heraklion).\\nCretan Salad\\nIf you do not want to wait until you get to Crete and taste the local\\nDakos\\n, you can make a Cretan salad (Krititki Salata) from ingredients you can find in your local grocery store. You can combine tomato, cucumber, onion, purslane, and barley rusk in a big bowl.\\nWell, that might be the official recipe, the truth is that Cretan salads will include whatever fresh ingredient you have, and it will always be delicious!\\nAdd virgin olive oil if you have it, then toss and mix everything. Finally, arrange it on a plate, top it with myzithra cheese, and drizzle it with Greek oregano. And ready to taste! This salad is served in many restaurants and taverns in Crete and is one of the most important dishes in a typical family lunch.\\nCretan Salad.\\nSfakian Pie\\nSfakian pie or\\nSfakiani Pita\\nis a crepe-thin pie that you can find in the region of Sfakia in Crete. It is stuffed with soft cheese making it one of the most delicious and juicy pies in the whole of Greece if not the world.\\nIts ingredients include flour, mizithra, olive oil, and raki. You can eat it as a snack, starter, or dessert. You decide. Apart from the local taverns and stores in the region, there is an annual event called the Sfakian Pie Festival that takes place every August in the mountain village of Sfakia. There, you have the opportunity to indulge in one of the most delicious gastronomic festivals in the entirety of Crete.\\nSfakian Pie.\\nGardoumia\\nFor all the meat lovers out there, a visit to Crete would be incomplete if you don’t try the local\\nAddirittura Gardoumia\\n, or simply\\nGardoumia\\n. This dish is a special meze made from lamb intestines.\\nTraditionally, the population in the mountainous areas of Crete considers this dish one of the most luxurious and delicious plates they can have.\\nThey save the lamb guts in low temperatures- fridges if they have them- and take them out only for special occasions, such as Christmas, Easter, or weddings.\\nIn general,\\nGardoumia\\nis cooked in three phases: first in a pot to fry it, then on the coals, and finally in the oven. The final result is simply exquisite.\\nGardoumia.\\nStamnagathi\\xa0(with Local Lamb)\\nLamb with\\nStamnagathi\\nis what it sounds: lamb served with\\nstamnagathi\\n, a local wild green very similar to chicory. Although the dish is slightly bitter due to the wild plant, it still has an enjoyable taste, especially if the lamb is coming from the local shepherds.\\nLamb is usually boiled and served with olive oil and lemon. If you are a meat lover, you want to taste this specialty. There is no way around it.\\nWild greens from Crete.\\nTsigariasto\\nAnother meat dish original to Crete is\\nTsigariasto\\n. Made from goat or lamb, this delicious plate is cooked at very low temperatures for more than a few hours. Although it may take quite some time to prepare, the wait is certainly worth it.\\nHistorically, and especially during the Ottoman years, locals used the delicious meat of the Cretan wild goat, also known as\\nAgrimi\\n(although locals love to call it Kri-Kri) to make this Cretan specialty.\\nAlthough\\nAgrimi\\nis now a protected species, the quality of the meat selected is always high. Be prepared for some of the finest meat dishes in Crete.\\nTsigariasto.\\nMarathopita\\nMarathopita\\nis a delicious pie made in Crete and is available all over the island. Its ingredients include spinach, sorrel, and fresh onion. Some housewives make it with fennel though.\\nThe pie is also rich in fennel which adds an extra sense of freshness and flavor. All in all, it is a convenient choice for a takeaway snack or breakfast if you visit a local bakery. Or you can order it as an appetizar in a restaurant.\\nMarathopita.\\nPaximadi\\nIf you are sick and tired of the traditional bread, then you have to try\\nPaximadi\\n, also known as rusks. These small but hard pieces of bread are repeatedly cooked to become some of the finest types of bread you will ever taste.\\nAlthough it may be hard to cut, you can soften it with water or olive oil before you serve it. It also has the added benefit that it can last for months in the pantry. Hence, you don’t need to worry about getting fresh bread every day. Very handy in emergency cases when you run out of fresh bread.\\nCretan rusk.\\nKatsiki (Baby Goat) with Potatoes and Chestnuts\\nOne of the most delicious things you can try in the region of Chania is chestnuts. The region of Chania is home to Elos, the so-called\\nchestnut village of Crete\\n,\\nThis little village is located at the end of the Topolia Gorge, on the way to\\nElafonisi Beach\\nand it is a must-stop place if you are interested in trying the most authentic mountain dishes on the island.\\nBaby goat (kid) with baked chestnuts and potatoes is one of the typical delicacies you can try in one of the three restaurants in the village. And it is truly delicious!\\nBaby goat in the oven with chestnuts and potatoes (\\nKatsiki me kastana kai patates\\n).\\nAnthous (Stuffed zucchini flowers)\\nEverybody is familiar with stuffed vine leaves, but in Crete, especially during the summer, zucchini flowers stuffed with rice, aromatic herbs, lemon juice, and a few drops of olive oil, fried in abundant olive oil are a common and super delicious\\norektikà (starter)\\nthat is served with a big side portion of Greek yogurt.\\nThis is a fresh dish, perfect to start any lunch or dinner, and, if well seasoned with freshly-cut herbs including dill and mint, is simply perfect!\\nAnthi: Fried zucchini flowers stuffed with rice and herbs, olive oil, and lemon.\\nSoupià Stuffed with Myzithra Cheese\\nAnother amazing dish, terrific on our hot summer nights, is this stunning seafood dish that features fresh cuttlefish stuffed with local soft goat cheese. Although the combination might sound weird, if you try it you will fall in love.\\nBest place to try this? Bourbos Kafenio, in the\\nSplantzia neighborhood (I talk about them here)\\n, in the\\nold town of Chania\\n. Sprinkle with some drops of fresh lemon juice and thank me later!\\nStuffed cuttlefish.\\nXoriatiko Loukaniko\\nOne more simple traditional dish that locals love to order as a starter is the so-called village sausage (\\nxoriatiko loukaniko\\n).\\nThese sausages are usually slightly smoked, which makes their taste incredibly delicious. They are grilled and often served with a small side dish of fried potatoes.If you have kids that are not really happy to try new flavors, this dish will make both the children and the parents happy!\\nVillage sausages (\\nXoriatiki Loukanika\\n).\\nSpoon Sweets\\nSpoon sweets are delicious sweet preserves, served in a spoon as a gesture of hospitality in many areas of Greece. Yet, Crete has its traditions and exquisite delicacies when it comes to those desserts.\\nYou can find spoon sweets made from cherry, peach, orange, and many other fresh, sour, and bitter fruits here. In addition, some also use vegetables to create their special spoon sweets. Be it tomato, pumpkin, or even cucumber.\\nNot only can you order these desserts from restaurants and taverns alike in Crete, but you can also buy them in large quantities from any bakery or candy store.\\nSpoon sweets.\\n>> Want to try making a typical Cretan Grape Spoon Sweet?\\nCheck out this traditional recipe!\\nLychnarakia\\nIf you happen to be in Crete around Greek Easter, you will notice the locals eating\\nKalitsounia\\nall the time, normally known as\\nLychnarakia\\nin Crete (while\\nKalitsounia\\nis mostly used for similar small savory pies). From breakfast or snack to brunch or a side sweet to sever with the coffee.\\nThese pastries are carefully handmade and shaped into tiny cups filled with sweet cheese. Depending on the region and time of your visit, the type of cheese may vary. However, the final result is always tasty.\\nAnd it is so all year since you can find these even outside Easter. Local bakeries fry or bake them all year round. Some of them are also sprinkled with cinnamon or sesame seeds. Yummy!\\nLychnarakia.\\nLoukoumades\\nAlthough\\nLoukoumades\\ncan be found almost everywhere in Greece, Crete has their specialties and hidden recipes. There are as many types and tastes of\\nLoukoumades\\nas there are stores that cook them. Even the tiniest change in the recipe, proportions, or procedure used can bring completely different results.\\nHowever, these fried doughs always come together with ice cream, nuts, or Cretan honey. Hence, this is also a unique opportunity to try the Cretan thyme honey or local ice cream made with milk from sheep.\\nIf you are lucky,\\nLoukoumades\\nmay be the “on-the-house” dessert (known as\\nkerasma\\n) you will have during dinner in one of the Cretan restaurants you will visit. If that is the case, you are the chosen one! Rejoice and enjoy!\\nLoukoumades.\\nTsikoudia (Raki)\\nLast but not least, when you come to Crete, you have to try tsikoudia. If you don’t, here you have an extra reason to come back. Fair enough, raki is not a plate or a snack. It is however the most popular alcoholic beverage in Crete.\\nThere is a rumor that drinking a small glass of\\nraki\\nevery morning once you wake up can bring longevity. If you are curious to know how Cretans make this famous beverage, you have to visit one of the hundreds of local wineries in Crete.\\nTo not spoil the surprise, get ready to see and experience firsthand how tasteful and healthy the so-called “leftovers” of the wine-making process can be.\\xa0And for those with a sweet tooth,\\nrakomelo\\n, – which is\\nraki\\nwith local honey – is a must-try.\\n>> Have you ever tried Cretan raki?\\nRead more here\\n.\\nRaki.\\nWhat to Drink: Wine Pairing in Crete\\nAre you wondering what you can drink when sampling such delicious dishes?

Welcome to our blog on the 10 reasons to fall in love with Crete this summer. Sydney grew up in Virginia just outside of Washington D.C. and Davis grew up in Los Angeles, California.\\nWe met in college while out dancing one night and were married after less than a year of dating. Sydney was studying Chemical Engineering and Davis was studying Opera Performance. It was during our time in college that we decided to get married and build our lives together.\\nWhen we first graduated, we went on a month-long trip to Southeast Asia and bought our first DSLR camera. After this trip we officially caught the travel bug! But then we moved to Houston to start our careers.\\nAt the time, travel filled our dreams but we didn’t know how to make it our jobs. Sydney was working in marketing which meant she was on a plane every week flying around the US to meet clients. Most of her time was spent in meetings rather than seeing the destinations.\\nShe grew tired of always being away from Davis and spending her life inside conference rooms doing something she wasn’t really passionate about. One day she just decided that she wasn’t going to let her life pass her by. So, she quit her job to focus on a new travel business full time.\\nWhat we love most about travel is learning just how diverse the world is. We are reminded time and time again that we are all human beings and all deal with a lot of the same fears and joys – no matter where we come from.\\nInspiration to Visit the Beautifully Diverse Crete\\nOn our first trip to Greece before starting our travel business, we visited the stunning island of Santorini. It was one of our best travel experiences. After getting a taste of Greek life, we wanted to come back as quick as possible.\\nWe heard that Crete was the largest Greek island offering amazing diversity such as beautiful beaches, epic mountains and cute villages. So we were eager to visit and explore the many facets of this island for ourselves.\\nOur trip was 4 days long and we spent most of our time on the western side of the island. We landed in\\nChania and rented a car\\n. This made it easy to explore the island in freedom whenever and wherever we wanted.\\nSeitan Limania beach was our first stop due to its proximity to the airport. We were stunned at just how gorgeous this initial journey was on the island. The next couple of days were spent exploring different beaches including Balso, Elafonisi, Georgioupolis, Rethymno, Matala and Heraklion.\\nThe diversity of Crete was nothing short of amazing with shoreline’s reminiscent of French Polynesia. Then there were the villages lined with cobblestone streets and fresh flowers, and mountains lurking on the horizon. We loved the different black, white and pink sand beaches.\\nThe people of Crete were also generous and willing to teach us about the culture. It is a very warm and welcoming place. The Greek people have such big hearts and treated us as if we were all part of one big family.\\nHeavenly Little Beaches in Crete © Sydney & Davis\\nDiscovering Epic Little Beach Spots in Crete © Sydney & Davis\\nExploring the Wonderful Architecture in Crete © Sydney & Davis\\nSunset over Chania © Sydney & Davis\\nFavourite Place in Crete – Balos Beach\\nWe loved every aspect of Crete and wish we had more time to soak it all in. Our favourite place that we experienced in our 4 days was Balos beach. We arrived early in the day and had some peaceful morning hours alone on the beach. But the actual journey there was what made it special.\\nTraversing the dirt roads that wind their way through the sweeping coast of northwest Crete was amazing. We even got stuck behind a herd of goats along the way. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to roll down the windows and listen to the goat bells clang as we followed them.\\nAnd then, when we arrived, the view of the beach was hidden from us at the parking lot. We were only able to soak in the views once we started hiking down. The water was many different shades of turquoise with gorgeous white sand – and we could see the iconic island on the horizon.\\nIt was hands down one of the best beaches we have ever seen!\\nWinding Dirt Roads to Balos Beach © Sydney & Davis\\nPath Down to Balos Beach © Sydney & Davis\\nStunning Views of Balos Beach © Sydney & Davis\\nSpecial Moments on a Beautiful Day at Balos Beach © Sydney & Davis\\n10 Best Things To Do in Crete\\nCrete offers a rich tapestry of summer experiences that can’t be matched anywhere. From idyllic beaches and vibrant cities, to wonderful cuisines and exciting festivals – there are endless possibilities on this charismatic island. See our top 10 reasons to fall in love with Crete this summer below.\\n1. Spend a Day at the Beautiful Balos Beach\\nBalos beach was our favourite place in Crete and it’s easy to see why people fall in love with this destination. For starters, the view of the different bays on the hike down is priceless. We loved spending the day here – swimming in the pure turquoise waters and enjoying the wild natural beauty.\\nBreathtaking Scenes at Balos Beach © Sydney & Davis\\n2. Visit the Stunning Elafonissi Beach of Crete\\nElafonissi beach\\nis full of coves and clear shallow waters. Combine the turquoise waters here with the unique pink-coloured sand and you have one of the most stunning beaches in Crete. The beach is located around 2 hours drive from Chania, making it a fun road trip to get there.\\nPink Sands of Elafonissi Beach © Sydney & Davis\\n3. Wander the Quaint Streets of Heraklion\\nWe loved the twists and turns in the streets of Heraklion. It felt like we were in the epitome of a traditional Greek town. This is the largest city of Crete and one of the major urban centres in Greece. Highlights include visiting the Venetian Harbour, Knossos, Koules Fortress and more.\\n4. Watch the Sunset from Charming Rethymno\\nThere’s a cool vibe in\\nRethymno\\n, especially at night when restaurant-goers fill the marina. The town combines the charm and history of traditional Greek streets with proximity to a nice long beach. This makes it an attractive place to visit. It’s also a serene destination to watch the sunset.\\nWaiting for Sunset in the Charming Town of Rethymno © Sydney & Davis\\n5. Discover the St. Nicholas Church at Georgioupolis\\nThe path out to the church of St. Nicholas is super picturesque and can be a transformational experience. It was a beautiful spot to soak in the ocean surroundings and admire the classic white church architecture. St. Nicholas church is one of the most photographed places in Crete.\\nPath out to the Gorgeous Church of St. Nicholas © Sydney & Davis\\n6. Explore the Caves of Matala in Crete\\nThe Caves of Matala offer so much history. Indeed, hiking around the cliffside caves felt like we were going back in time. These rocks were carved out thousands of years ago in the steep cliffs that rise above the north side of the beach. Many believe that they are Roman or Early Christian tombs.\\n7. Take a Lovely Boat Ride to Loutro\\nUnfortunately, we didn’t get the chance to visit this gem but we heard so many amazing things about\\nLoutro\\n. It’s a peaceful village that offers stunning views and nothing more than a few hotels, taverns, mini-markets, blue houses, a pebble beach and fish taverns. It’s a magical little spot.\\n8. Swim at the Unique Seitan Limania Beach\\nSeitan Limania beach is probably the place you have seen the most photos of. The shape of the bay is totally unique (like a zig-zag) and the water is electric blue. We have never seen anything quite like this on a beach. We recommend spending at least one afternoon here, swimming and relaxing.\\nThe Incredible Seitan Limania Beach © Sydney & Davis\\n9. Stop at a Roadside Fruit Stand for a Snack\\nWe love tasting local produce wherever we go and the roadside fruit stands in Crete gave us this opportunity. The fruit on this island is ridiculously fresh. Make sure you try the oranges made in Maleme, cherries from Gerakari, bananas from Arvi and apples from Lassithi Plateau.\\nFruit Trees in the Villages of Crete © Sydney & Davis\\n10. Swim in the Ocean Everyday in Crete\\nOur last reason why you will fall in love with Crete is an obvious one. Swimming in the ocean is a typical summer experience and Crete is blessed with many beautiful beaches. The temperature gets quite high in summer so make sure you cool off whenever you can.\\nCrystal Clear Waters of Crete © Sydney & Davis\\nLife is a Beach in Crete © Sydney & Davis\\nBeautiful Moments at Rethymno\\nOur favourite memory from our trip was watching the sunset in Rethymno. We were out on the jetty, watching the sunset over the ocean. The sky was a fiery orange for about half an hour and then a small silver moon came sparkling out. Meanwhile, the nearby restaurants started to fill up.\\nWe listened to the atmosphere of the restaurants coming to life along the marina and watched the city light up as the sky grew darker. It was our last night in Crete – so we were doing our best to soak in the atmosphere.\\nGorgeous Sunset in the Charming Rethymno © Sydney & Davis\\nWhat you Need to Know Before you Go\\nThe first tip we can give is to try the local cuisine of Crete. Greek food is one of our favourites and we love the light Mediterranean flavours. From charcoal grilled vegetables to crisp Greek salads covered in herbs and olive oils. We would have this combo almost every night in Crete.\\nDefinitely rent a car so you can explore the largest Greek island by yourself. Depending on the amount of time you have, we recommend focusing on one side of the island at a time. We stayed on the western part of Crete but can’t wait to explore the east coast on our next trip.\\nBY SYDNEY & DAVIS\\nIG: @THE_ESCAPE_ARTISTS\\nWWW.THESCAPEARTISTS.COM\\nTags :\\nShare This Post :\\nMagnificent World\\nFor the Journey.\\n[email\\xa0protected]\\nLearn More\\nHome\\nDestinations\\nAbout\\nPrivacy Policy\\nNewsletter\\nEmail\\nSIGN UP\\nSign Up', 'url': 'https://www.magnificentworld.com/things-to-do-in-crete-summer/', 'summarised': 'Here is a summary of the article in 1000 words:\\n\\nSydney and Davis, a couple who met in college and got married after less than a year, share their love for travel and their experience visiting Crete, Greece.

Here are our recommendations.\\nThose who come to Crete enjoy the\\nendless beaches\\nof this beautiful Mediterranean island, the hospitality and the\\ngood food\\n. But the island pearl has much more to offer, because Crete, with its millennia-old history, has always been a center of European culture. Archaeologists have found out that Crete has been continuously inhabited by people since 6,000 BC.\\nCountless finds and excavation sites on the island tell the varied and adventurous story of its inhabitants. Crete was home to the first high culture in Europe from the third millennium BC onwards. The Minoans and their impressive culture played a major role in the development of the ancient Greek world. The legends that originated during this time and were later passed on from mouth to mouth also had a great influence on the Greek mythology.\\nAnyone who wants to immerse themselves in this fabulous and legendary world of ancient Greece can do so without difficulty by visiting the numerous museums or excavation sites on the island. Forget for a few hours the hustle and bustle of our modern world and let yourself be captivated by long forgotten worlds.\\n1\\nThe archaeological museum in Chania\\nChania is one of Crete\\'s hotspots for archaeology. The first human settlements in the city could be traced back to the period 3,400 to 3,000 BC. Based on tradition, scientists today assume that it was founded by the mythical king Minos. Kudonija, as the city was originally called, had one of the most important ceramic production of its time and maintained trade relations as far away as Egypt, Cyprus and Palestine. But nothing lasts forever and so the Minoan culture had to bow to other cultures over the millennia. Finds from various excavation sites tell of this extremely exciting and eventful history of the island. They are kept like a precious treasure in the museums of Chania, for example, and made accessible to interested visitors.\\nThere is no more beautiful museum building than the former Venetian Franciscan church in Gothic style in the whole of Crete. It houses some of what archaeologists have found in Chania and the surrounding area over the last 100 years. The unique ambience of this archaeological museum is enhanced by the small outer courtyard, which used to be part of the cloister. Visitors to the museum can admire important finds from the pre-Christian period, including a Minoan clay seal known as the \"Seal of the Sovereign\". The representation on the seal shows a powerful male figure standing on the roof of a building in front of the Kastelli Hills in Chania.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\n2\\nThe archaeological museum in Eleftherna\\nEleftherna was one of the most important Cretan city states in Greek and Roman antiquity. Cretan archaeologists have only been digging here since 1985 and are now planning to continue digging. What they have already found and what they will find in the future will find its place in the ultra-modern Archaeological Museum, which opens in 2016. For visitors, the excavations are an experience not only because of their historical dimension, but also because of the landscape and nature.\\nopen in Google Maps\\n3\\nThe nautical museum in Chania\\nThe only shipping museum on our island is the striking dark red building at the western end of the harbour. If you are enthusiastic about seafaring and nautics, you have come to the right place. With the help of the numerous and well-preserved exhibits of the Nautical Museum of Chania, the visitor learns a lot about the millennia-old seafaring tradition of Crete. The three permanent exhibition areas of this house show the marine environment of the Mediterranean island, the battle of Crete during the Second World War and the ancient shipbuilding tradition of the island. Among other things, legendary creatures of the deep sea, exhibits from 1941, which tell of one of the worst chapters of the Second World War, and exhibits that bring the old Minoan shipbuilding tradition back to life. Although not a single one of these ancient ships has been salvaged, wall paintings testify to their artful construction. A replica of these ships can be admired in the Venetian shipyard hall in the port of Chania. If you concentrate on the main exhibits in the two-storey building, you will hardly need more than half an hour for a visit.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\n4\\nThe Minoan ship of Chania\\nThe wealth and prosperity of Crete in the 2nd millennium B.C. was not only based on the fertility of the island but also on the intensive trade the Minoans carried on in the eastern Mediterranean. But what did their ships look like? Not a single wreck of a Minoan ship has been found so far, but only representations on wall paintings. But you can now see a Minoan ship - in a Venetian dockyard at the port of Chania.\\nDiscover more...\\n5\\nThe archaeological museum in Heraklion\\nWe now turn to Heraklion, another cultural centre of ancient Crete. According to Greek mythology, Heracles is said to have gone ashore in Heraklion, which means \"Heracles city\" in English, to capture the legendary Cretan bull. In ancient times\\nHeraklion\\nwas one of the four harbor towns around the legendary city of Knossos, which maintained a variety of trade relations in the Mediterranean.\\nThe Archaeological Museum in the island\\'s capital is the most important and largest museum on the island. Here you will get the best impression of how varied and high quality the art work on Crete was about 3500 years ago. But you will also gain an insight into the fashion, everyday life, crafts, festivals and leisure activities of the Minoans of that time. You should plan at least two hours for a tour of the two museum floors.\\nopen in Google Maps\\n6\\nThe historical museum in Heraklion\\nRulers came, rulers left Crete. The collapse of the once so powerful Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity have not left Crete without a trace. If you want to get an idea of this extremely varied and exciting time, you should definitely plan a visit to the historical museum of Heraklion. With the help of modern exhibition concepts involving audiovisual media, you will be immersed in a time when Ottomans and Byzantines determined the history of the island. The highlight of the exhibition is the painting \\'The Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai\\' by the famous painter El Greco. It is the only work of the artist on the island, who was originally born as Domínikos Theotokópoulos in Crete and achieved fame and glory in Spain.\\nThe \\'Historical Museum of Crete\\' shows a collection of objects from the island\\'s history during the Christian era in an old and a new building. In front of the ticket office, the figurehead of a Venetian galley of the 16th/17th century hangs on the wall on the right. These animals have apparently always fascinated people. Here they are probably supposed to keep all evil away from the ship like ancient Gorgons.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\n7\\nThe Museum of Christian Art in Heraklion\\nThe small museum with a modern design in the church of St. Catherine of Sinai, built as early as the 13th century, houses the most valuable icons of the island, bringing visitors closer to Byzantine icon painting in Crete. Even those who have little interest in pious paintings will be delighted with a little artistic sense, because in them the strict theological canon of Byzantine icon painting is combined with the vividness of Western Renaissance art.\\nopen in Google Maps\\n8\\nThe Natural History Museum in Heraklion\\nInterested visitors can find out more about the island\\'s past and present flora and fauna in the Heraklion Natural History Museum. The museum has an impressive area of 3,500 m², making it the largest exhibition of its kind in the Mediterranean. A visit to the museum is highly recommended, because here you can discover the natural characteristics of the Mediterranean in an original way. You will also learn interesting facts about the former and current animal world.\\nA visit to the live museum is particularly recommended. This is a very special museum complex consisting of many small aquariums and terrariums for live animals such as snakes and lizards, thus illustrating the fauna of the eastern Mediterranean. Mega-dioramas impressively convey the various ecosystems of the eastern Mediterranean region and with the almost complete skeleton of the giant Dinotherium, an elephant-like animal can be marvelled at, which had its habitat in Crete a good nine million years ago.\\nIn 1981, the natural history museum was founded under the patronage of the University of Crete. It carries out impressive pioneering work in the following areas: studying and managing the environment of Crete, promoting education, raising awareness among the local population and visitors to Crete.\\nopen in Google Maps\\n9\\nThe archaeological museum in Rethymno\\nThe old Archaeological Museum of the city in front of the entrance to the Fortezza was closed in 2015. A new one is planned, but is unlikely to be built before 2022. Some particularly important and exemplary objects from the rich collection will remain on display in the former Roman Catholic Church of San Francesco for as long as this is the case. Although the exhibition is small, it has been arranged very lovingly. A tour takes about 10-15 minutes.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\n10\\nThe archaeological museum in Kissamos\\nThe west of Crete only became increasingly important in the classical and Roman antiquity. For from this time on, the western Mediterranean area was also discovered as a trading partner for the island\\'s goods. The most interesting archaeological finds from this period are exhibited in the archaeological district museum of Kissamos. The heart of the exhibition are two very well preserved mosaics from Roman times. The mosaics are made of white, grey and red-brown mosaic stones and show the life in the urban villas of the Greek-Roman Kissamos. Also very remarkable are a sundial from that time and life-size Roman marble statues. The museum is housed in an administrative building from the Venetian-Ottoman period which, thanks to expert restorers and craftsmen, forms the traditional heart of the town.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\n11\\nThe archaeological museum in Ierapetra\\nThe small museum in a school built in 1899 especially for the Muslim children of the city presents only few but very interesting finds from the region. The English language explanatory panels are relatively detailed and informative. As soon as you enter you look through the long, narrow alignment of the two halls at an almost completely preserved marble statue of the goddess Persephone from the 2nd century AD.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\nCorissia Travel Guide ™\\nexperiences\\nWhat would you like to\\nexperience\\nwhile on holiday in Crete?\\nJust click on your preference\\nDiscover amazing beaches\\nStroll through old towns\\nDrive off-road with a jeep\\nCycle through beautiful nature\\nGet inspired in a museum\\nVisit secluded monasteries\\nEnter stalactite caves\\nAdmire archaeological sites\\nExplore pristine villages\\nDare extreme sports\\nHike through impressive gorges\\nGet to know Crete\\'s finest delicatessen\\nSense the Authentic Summer in Crete\\nSense the Authentic Adventure in Crete\\nSense the Authentic Taste in Crete\\nCorissia Travel Guide\\n™\\nDiscover your own amazing Crete\\nA free Crete travel guide with valuable insider tips.\\nDestination Crete: cosmopolitan and mystical at the same time\\nCrystal clear sea, fantastic bays and flat, golden sandy beaches\\nRomantic walks in dreamy harbour towns\\nWonderful hiking tours into the fascinating interior of the country\\nExciting cultural time travel in history and myth\\nPristine lifestyle and unique natural beauties\\nCorissia Travel Guide ™\\nexperiences\\nmuseum\\nCorissia Hotels & Resort\\n73007\\nGeorgioupolis\\nCrete\\nGreece\\nTel.:\\n+30 28250 83010-19\\nWe are a well-coordinated and\\nexperienced team\\nthat works with passion, energy and creativity to provide you with an all-round successful holiday experience.

Therefore, we decided to write two articles, one about the must-visit landmarks of culture and a second one about the lesser-known but equally important. So, stay tuned for next week’s article as well!\\nLet’s dive into which historical landmarks of culture we believe are the must-visits of Crete. We are also sharing a couple of our best experiences where we combine various of those landmarks!\\n\\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\\nIt is located in the center of the city and is one of the largest and most interesting museums in Greece. They founded it in 1908 to house the first collections of Cretan antiquities and today houses 7,500 exhibits, representative samples from the Neolithic era to Roman times. Its collection of Minoan antiquities is the most valuable in the world. It is rightly one of the most important museums of Minoan civilization. Finally, among the masterpieces of Minoan art on display, you will see the serpent goddesses, the Linear B tablets from Knossos, the Phaistos Disc, etc.\\n\\nElissos Tour:\\nKnossos Palace and the Archaeology Museum\\nYou start our day visiting the most important archaeological site on Crete and the second most visited archaeological site of the country, the Minoan palace of Knossos, the mythical Labyrinth of Hommer. Concentrating on the prehistoric era of the island, revealing its unique historic course, and penetrating its ancient prehistoric cult, arts, and ritual practices, you will be visiting an amazing area of 22.000sq meters.\\n\\nFinally, your journey into prehistoric times will end by visiting the biggest prehistoric collection of artifacts in Greece. The archaeological museum of Heraklion, where you can see at close range all treasures from all Minoan palaces and other Minoan areas excavated on Crete.\\n\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art of Rethymno\\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art was created by merging the old Municipal Gallery “L. Kanakakis” and the Center for Contemporary Visual Creation. Its permanent collection numbers around 680 works by contemporary Greek artists, representative examples of Greek visual reality from 1950 to today.\\n\\nMaritime Museum of Crete\\nThe Venetians built the main building of Revelino del Porto fortress to fortify the port of Chania. They founded it in 1973 to promote the maritime tradition and history of the island. The collections are organized into three exhibitions. Firstly, the permanent collection includes 2,500 items.

      "(('perform_web_search:c5d347ca-12b9-ab1e-e983-564fbc9a1dba',), {'doc_summariser': {'docs': [{'document_html': \"Here is the cleaned-up text, removing unnecessary preamble and navigation:\\n\\n10 Cretan dishes to try\\n\\n1. Cretan Cheeses\\nIt seems that almost every Cretan village has its own signature cheese. They are usually made from sheep or goat’s milk, or a combination of both and each cheese variety has its local interpretation. Of the legion of delicious cheeses, look for graviera, a harder cheese that’s sweeter when new, but nutty and flavourful after aging. Soft, creamy cheeses, abound like pichtogalo Chanion, which has AOC protection, or myzithra, a young whey cheese with a lovely mild taste.\\n\\n2. Dakos\\nThe ever-popular dakos is known by regional names throughout Crete…some call it koukouvagia (literally ‘owl’); in the east they call it kouloukopsomo (literally ‘puppy bread’). What is it? A fantastic Greek meze or salad reminiscent of bruschetta, but based on barley rusks or paximadi, not on bread. The rusks are lightly soaked in water or olive oil to soften them, and then they are topped with grated fresh tomato and myzithra, the creamy sheep or goat’s milk cheese. They are then drizzled with Cretan virgin olive oil and dusted with salt, oregano, pepper.\\n\\n3. Fried snails (Chochlioi boubouristi)\\nIt’s not only the French who treat snails as a delicacy. In fact, snails have been eaten for millennia. In the Cretan dialect cochlios means snail, and in this dish they are fried with flour and hot olive oil in a pan, then doused with wine (or vinegar), and voila, ready to serve. Some like to add a dash of wild rosemary. Locally, women collect the snails by hand and the creatures are cooked up live.\\n\\n4. Cretan Cheese Pies (Kaltsounia)\\nThese small pies may look like the multitude of cheese pies you’ll encounter throughout Greece, but these are unique! To start, handmade pastry dough is a must, usually shaped into tiny cups. The fillings vary – every region and often each household has its favourite. They tend toward the sweet, and count on any number of those luscious Cretan cheeses, like myzithra or malaka, but not feta. We like the ones that incorporate a hint of rosewater. The final touch is Cretan honey on the top, making the pies a heady combination of sweet and savoury.\\n\\n5. Lamb with stamnagathi\\nAs with most Greek foods, Cretans have their own take on lamb. Their version incorporates stamnagathi, a wild green that has become trendy of late, and features on many top-end restaurant menus. The Cretan lamb is sautéed in hot olive oil and oregano accompanied with the stamnagathi green and the well-known avgolemono (egg and lemon-based) sauce, or, more simply, a squeeze of fresh lemon.\\n\\n6. Gamopilafo\\nAs the name hints (gamos means ‘wedding’ in Greek) this rice dish is offered at traditional Cretan weddings. These days you will find it not only when the whole village is celebrating nuptials in the town square, but also in many Cretan tavernas. Like a deluxe risotto, it is prepared in a rich meat broth that you make from a lengthy simmering of goat, lamb or rooster. Then you incorporate a dash of lemon juice and liberal amounts of stakovoutiro – this is a butter created from the creamy skin that forms on the top of boiled fresh goat's milk and is turned into a roux. It is the crème de la crème!\\n\\n7. Mountain Bulbs (Askordoulakous)\\nPart of the magic of Cretan food are the ingredients gathered from hillsides and around villages. Askordoulakous are the bulbs of a wild green, and Cretans gather bulbs and eat them as a fresh salad, dressed with oil and vinegar or lemon. They also pickle them, or stew them with local olive oil, vinegar and flour. The delicate white blossoms of the green are also edible, simply boiled or used in other dishes.\\n\\n8. Smoked Pork (Hirina apakia)\\nNot an easy one to recreate outside of Greece, this dish of succulent smoked pork, is made in a multi-day process. First, strips of pork are marinated in vinegar for several days. Then a fire is made using local herbs - sage, bay, rosemary - and the meat is hung above it to smoke. The smoke is continuously stoked to keep the herby aroma infusing the meat. The final product tastes of the fresh herbs and can be served later, cold, in thin slices.\\n\\n9. Sfakia pies (Sfakianes pites)\\nThese yummy pies hale from southern Crete, from a mountainous coastal region called Sfakia. At a glance, these treats look like pancakes, but beyond the flour, the dough contains local olive oil, and the infamous Cretan liquor, raki. Then, any number of the various Cretan fresh, soft, white goat or sheep’s milk cheeses like myzithra or pichtogalo Chanion are incorporated into the centre of the pie. Fried with only a light brushing of olive oil, they are eaten with a drizzling of thyme or heather honey.\\n\\n10. Cretan Brandy (Raki or Tsikoudia)\\nIn the fall, after the grape harvest, you will find villagers all around Crete carefully tending open fires under copper stills.

We are also sharing a couple of our best experiences where we combine various of those landmarks!\\n\\nHeraklion Archaeological Museum\\nIt is located in the center of the city and is one of the largest and most interesting museums in Greece. They founded it in 1908 to house the first collections of Cretan antiquities and today houses 7,500 exhibits, representative samples from the Neolithic era to Roman times. Its collection of Minoan antiquities is the most valuable in the world. It is rightly one of the most important museums of Minoan civilization. Finally, among the masterpieces of Minoan art on display, you will see the serpent goddesses, the Linear B tablets from Knossos, the Phaistos Disc, etc.\\n\\nElissos Tour:\\nKnossos Palace and the Archaeology Museum\\nYou start our day visiting the most important archaeological site on Crete and the second most visited archaeological site of the country, the Minoan palace of Knossos, the mythical Labyrinth of Hommer. Concentrating on the prehistoric era of the island, revealing its unique historic course, and penetrating its ancient prehistoric cult, arts, and ritual practices, you will be visiting an amazing area of 22.000sq meters.\\n\\nFinally, your journey into prehistoric times will end by visiting the biggest prehistoric collection of artifacts in Greece. The archaeological museum of Heraklion, where you can see at close range all treasures from all Minoan palaces and other Minoan areas excavated on Crete.\\n\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art of Rethymno\\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art was created by merging the old Municipal Gallery “L. Kanakakis” and the Center for Contemporary Visual Creation. Its permanent collection numbers around 680 works by contemporary Greek artists, representative examples of Greek visual reality from 1950 to today.\\n\\nMaritime Museum of Crete\\nThe Venetians built the main building of Revelino del Porto fortress to fortify the port of Chania. They founded it in 1973 to promote the maritime tradition and history of the island. The collections are organized into three exhibitions. Firstly, the permanent collection includes 2,500 items. Such as relics, paintings, maps, photographs, ship models, naval equipment, etc., which are presented in sections and chronological order from the Bronze Age to the present day.\\n\\nExhibit at Eleftherna Archaeological Museum\\nEleftherna Archaeological Museum\\nThe archaeological site of Archaia Eleftherna is 30 km from the city of Rethymno. Its main excavation area extends over the hills of Pyrgi and Nisi. In 2016 they inaugurated the museum.\\n\\nElissos Tour:\\nGreco-Roman Wonders\\nYou will start your day visiting the newly excavated ancient Greek City of Eleutherna and its unique Museum. Eleutherna is the most important archaeological site of the Rethimnon region.\\nBuilt in an area between three hills, Eleutherna is the location of impressive findings from the 9th century BC to the 5th century AD, such as the Necropolis or “Orthi Petra”, the Acropolis, and the Basilica of Archangel Michael.\\n\\nNatural History Museum of Crete\\nThe University of Crete investigates the natural peculiarities of Mediterranean countries.

Here are our recommendations.\\nThose who come to Crete enjoy the\\nendless beaches\\nof this beautiful Mediterranean island, the hospitality and the\\ngood food\\n. But the island pearl has much more to offer, because Crete, with its millennia-old history, has always been a center of European culture. Archaeologists have found out that Crete has been continuously inhabited by people since 6,000 BC.\\nCountless finds and excavation sites on the island tell the varied and adventurous story of its inhabitants. Crete was home to the first high culture in Europe from the third millennium BC onwards. The Minoans and their impressive culture played a major role in the development of the ancient Greek world. The legends that originated during this time and were later passed on from mouth to mouth also had a great influence on the Greek mythology.\\nAnyone who wants to immerse themselves in this fabulous and legendary world of ancient Greece can do so without difficulty by visiting the numerous museums or excavation sites on the island. Forget for a few hours the hustle and bustle of our modern world and let yourself be captivated by long forgotten worlds.\\n1\\nThe archaeological museum in Chania\\nChania is one of Crete\\'s hotspots for archaeology. The first human settlements in the city could be traced back to the period 3,400 to 3,000 BC. Based on tradition, scientists today assume that it was founded by the mythical king Minos. Kudonija, as the city was originally called, had one of the most important ceramic production of its time and maintained trade relations as far away as Egypt, Cyprus and Palestine. But nothing lasts forever and so the Minoan culture had to bow to other cultures over the millennia. Finds from various excavation sites tell of this extremely exciting and eventful history of the island. They are kept like a precious treasure in the museums of Chania, for example, and made accessible to interested visitors.\\nThere is no more beautiful museum building than the former Venetian Franciscan church in Gothic style in the whole of Crete. It houses some of what archaeologists have found in Chania and the surrounding area over the last 100 years. The unique ambience of this archaeological museum is enhanced by the small outer courtyard, which used to be part of the cloister. Visitors to the museum can admire important finds from the pre-Christian period, including a Minoan clay seal known as the \"Seal of the Sovereign\". The representation on the seal shows a powerful male figure standing on the roof of a building in front of the Kastelli Hills in Chania.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\n2\\nThe archaeological museum in Eleftherna\\nEleftherna was one of the most important Cretan city states in Greek and Roman antiquity. Cretan archaeologists have only been digging here since 1985 and are now planning to continue digging. What they have already found and what they will find in the future will find its place in the ultra-modern Archaeological Museum, which opens in 2016. For visitors, the excavations are an experience not only because of their historical dimension, but also because of the landscape and nature.\\nopen in Google Maps\\n3\\nThe nautical museum in Chania\\nThe only shipping museum on our island is the striking dark red building at the western end of the harbour. If you are enthusiastic about seafaring and nautics, you have come to the right place. With the help of the numerous and well-preserved exhibits of the Nautical Museum of Chania, the visitor learns a lot about the millennia-old seafaring tradition of Crete. The three permanent exhibition areas of this house show the marine environment of the Mediterranean island, the battle of Crete during the Second World War and the ancient shipbuilding tradition of the island. Among other things, legendary creatures of the deep sea, exhibits from 1941, which tell of one of the worst chapters of the Second World War, and exhibits that bring the old Minoan shipbuilding tradition back to life. Although not a single one of these ancient ships has been salvaged, wall paintings testify to their artful construction. A replica of these ships can be admired in the Venetian shipyard hall in the port of Chania. If you concentrate on the main exhibits in the two-storey building, you will hardly need more than half an hour for a visit.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\n4\\nThe Minoan ship of Chania\\nThe wealth and prosperity of Crete in the 2nd millennium B.C. was not only based on the fertility of the island but also on the intensive trade the Minoans carried on in the eastern Mediterranean. But what did their ships look like? Not a single wreck of a Minoan ship has been found so far, but only representations on wall paintings. But you can now see a Minoan ship - in a Venetian dockyard at the port of Chania.\\nDiscover more...\\n5\\nThe archaeological museum in Heraklion\\nWe now turn to Heraklion, another cultural centre of ancient Crete. According to Greek mythology, Heracles is said to have gone ashore in Heraklion, which means \"Heracles city\" in English, to capture the legendary Cretan bull. In ancient times\\nHeraklion\\nwas one of the four harbor towns around the legendary city of Knossos, which maintained a variety of trade relations in the Mediterranean.\\nThe Archaeological Museum in the island\\'s capital is the most important and largest museum on the island. Here you will get the best impression of how varied and high quality the art work on Crete was about 3500 years ago. But you will also gain an insight into the fashion, everyday life, crafts, festivals and leisure activities of the Minoans of that time. You should plan at least two hours for a tour of the two museum floors.\\nopen in Google Maps\\n6\\nThe historical museum in Heraklion\\nRulers came, rulers left Crete. The collapse of the once so powerful Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity have not left Crete without a trace. If you want to get an idea of this extremely varied and exciting time, you should definitely plan a visit to the historical museum of Heraklion. With the help of modern exhibition concepts involving audiovisual media, you will be immersed in a time when Ottomans and Byzantines determined the history of the island. The highlight of the exhibition is the painting \\'The Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai\\' by the famous painter El Greco. It is the only work of the artist on the island, who was originally born as Domínikos Theotokópoulos in Crete and achieved fame and glory in Spain.\\nThe \\'Historical Museum of Crete\\' shows a collection of objects from the island\\'s history during the Christian era in an old and a new building. In front of the ticket office, the figurehead of a Venetian galley of the 16th/17th century hangs on the wall on the right. These animals have apparently always fascinated people. Here they are probably supposed to keep all evil away from the ship like ancient Gorgons.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\n7\\nThe Museum of Christian Art in Heraklion\\nThe small museum with a modern design in the church of St. Catherine of Sinai, built as early as the 13th century, houses the most valuable icons of the island, bringing visitors closer to Byzantine icon painting in Crete. Even those who have little interest in pious paintings will be delighted with a little artistic sense, because in them the strict theological canon of Byzantine icon painting is combined with the vividness of Western Renaissance art.\\nopen in Google Maps\\n8\\nThe Natural History Museum in Heraklion\\nInterested visitors can find out more about the island\\'s past and present flora and fauna in the Heraklion Natural History Museum. The museum has an impressive area of 3,500 m², making it the largest exhibition of its kind in the Mediterranean. A visit to the museum is highly recommended, because here you can discover the natural characteristics of the Mediterranean in an original way. You will also learn interesting facts about the former and current animal world.\\nA visit to the live museum is particularly recommended. This is a very special museum complex consisting of many small aquariums and terrariums for live animals such as snakes and lizards, thus illustrating the fauna of the eastern Mediterranean. Mega-dioramas impressively convey the various ecosystems of the eastern Mediterranean region and with the almost complete skeleton of the giant Dinotherium, an elephant-like animal can be marvelled at, which had its habitat in Crete a good nine million years ago.\\nIn 1981, the natural history museum was founded under the patronage of the University of Crete. It carries out impressive pioneering work in the following areas: studying and managing the environment of Crete, promoting education, raising awareness among the local population and visitors to Crete.\\nopen in Google Maps\\n9\\nThe archaeological museum in Rethymno\\nThe old Archaeological Museum of the city in front of the entrance to the Fortezza was closed in 2015. A new one is planned, but is unlikely to be built before 2022. Some particularly important and exemplary objects from the rich collection will remain on display in the former Roman Catholic Church of San Francesco for as long as this is the case. Although the exhibition is small, it has been arranged very lovingly. A tour takes about 10-15 minutes.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\n10\\nThe archaeological museum in Kissamos\\nThe west of Crete only became increasingly important in the classical and Roman antiquity. For from this time on, the western Mediterranean area was also discovered as a trading partner for the island\\'s goods. The most interesting archaeological finds from this period are exhibited in the archaeological district museum of Kissamos. The heart of the exhibition are two very well preserved mosaics from Roman times. The mosaics are made of white, grey and red-brown mosaic stones and show the life in the urban villas of the Greek-Roman Kissamos. Also very remarkable are a sundial from that time and life-size Roman marble statues. The museum is housed in an administrative building from the Venetian-Ottoman period which, thanks to expert restorers and craftsmen, forms the traditional heart of the town.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\n11\\nThe archaeological museum in Ierapetra\\nThe small museum in a school built in 1899 especially for the Muslim children of the city presents only few but very interesting finds from the region. The English language explanatory panels are relatively detailed and informative. As soon as you enter you look through the long, narrow alignment of the two halls at an almost completely preserved marble statue of the goddess Persephone from the 2nd century AD.\\nDiscover more...\\nopen in Google Maps\\nCorissia Travel Guide ™\\nexperiences\\nWhat would you like to\\nexperience\\nwhile on holiday in Crete?\\nJust click on your preference\\nDiscover amazing beaches\\nStroll through old towns\\nDrive off-road with a jeep\\nCycle through beautiful nature\\nGet inspired in a museum\\nVisit secluded monasteries\\nEnter stalactite caves\\nAdmire archaeological sites\\nExplore pristine villages\\nDare extreme sports\\nHike through impressive gorges\\nGet to know Crete\\'s finest delicatessen\\nSense the Authentic Summer in Crete\\nSense the Authentic Adventure in Crete\\nSense the Authentic Taste in Crete\\nCorissia Travel Guide\\n™\\nDiscover your own amazing Crete\\nA free Crete travel guide with valuable insider tips.\\nDestination Crete: cosmopolitan and mystical at the same time\\nCrystal clear sea, fantastic bays and flat, golden sandy beaches\\nRomantic walks in dreamy harbour towns\\nWonderful hiking tours into the fascinating interior of the country\\nExciting cultural time travel in history and myth\\nPristine lifestyle and unique natural beauties\\nCorissia Travel Guide ™\\nexperiences\\nmuseum\\nCorissia Hotels & Resort\\n73007\\nGeorgioupolis\\nCrete\\nGreece\\nTel.:\\n+30 28250 83010-19\\nWe are a well-coordinated and\\nexperienced team\\nthat works with passion, energy and creativity to provide you with an all-round successful holiday experience.

Welcome to our blog on the 10 reasons to fall in love with Crete this summer. Sydney grew up in Virginia just outside of Washington D.C. and Davis grew up in Los Angeles, California.\\nWe met in college while out dancing one night and were married after less than a year of dating. Sydney was studying Chemical Engineering and Davis was studying Opera Performance. It was during our time in college that we decided to get married and build our lives together.\\nWhen we first graduated, we went on a month-long trip to Southeast Asia and bought our first DSLR camera. After this trip we officially caught the travel bug! But then we moved to Houston to start our careers.\\nAt the time, travel filled our dreams but we didn’t know how to make it our jobs. Sydney was working in marketing which meant she was on a plane every week flying around the US to meet clients. Most of her time was spent in meetings rather than seeing the destinations.\\nShe grew tired of always being away from Davis and spending her life inside conference rooms doing something she wasn’t really passionate about. One day she just decided that she wasn’t going to let her life pass her by. So, she quit her job to focus on a new travel business full time.\\nWhat we love most about travel is learning just how diverse the world is. We are reminded time and time again that we are all human beings and all deal with a lot of the same fears and joys – no matter where we come from.\\nInspiration to Visit the Beautifully Diverse Crete\\nOn our first trip to Greece before starting our travel business, we visited the stunning island of Santorini. It was one of our best travel experiences. After getting a taste of Greek life, we wanted to come back as quick as possible.\\nWe heard that Crete was the largest Greek island offering amazing diversity such as beautiful beaches, epic mountains and cute villages. So we were eager to visit and explore the many facets of this island for ourselves.\\nOur trip was 4 days long and we spent most of our time on the western side of the island. We landed in\\nChania and rented a car\\n. This made it easy to explore the island in freedom whenever and wherever we wanted.\\nSeitan Limania beach was our first stop due to its proximity to the airport. We were stunned at just how gorgeous this initial journey was on the island. The next couple of days were spent exploring different beaches including Balso, Elafonisi, Georgioupolis, Rethymno, Matala and Heraklion.\\nThe diversity of Crete was nothing short of amazing with shoreline’s reminiscent of French Polynesia. Then there were the villages lined with cobblestone streets and fresh flowers, and mountains lurking on the horizon. We loved the different black, white and pink sand beaches.\\nThe people of Crete were also generous and willing to teach us about the culture. It is a very warm and welcoming place. The Greek people have such big hearts and treated us as if we were all part of one big family.\\nHeavenly Little Beaches in Crete © Sydney & Davis\\nDiscovering Epic Little Beach Spots in Crete © Sydney & Davis\\nExploring the Wonderful Architecture in Crete © Sydney & Davis\\nSunset over Chania © Sydney & Davis\\nFavourite Place in Crete – Balos Beach\\nWe loved every aspect of Crete and wish we had more time to soak it all in. Our favourite place that we experienced in our 4 days was Balos beach. We arrived early in the day and had some peaceful morning hours alone on the beach. But the actual journey there was what made it special.\\nTraversing the dirt roads that wind their way through the sweeping coast of northwest Crete was amazing. We even got stuck behind a herd of goats along the way. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to roll down the windows and listen to the goat bells clang as we followed them.\\nAnd then, when we arrived, the view of the beach was hidden from us at the parking lot. We were only able to soak in the views once we started hiking down. The water was many different shades of turquoise with gorgeous white sand – and we could see the iconic island on the horizon.\\nIt was hands down one of the best beaches we have ever seen!\\nWinding Dirt Roads to Balos Beach © Sydney & Davis\\nPath Down to Balos Beach © Sydney & Davis\\nStunning Views of Balos Beach © Sydney & Davis\\nSpecial Moments on a Beautiful Day at Balos Beach © Sydney & Davis\\n10 Best Things To Do in Crete\\nCrete offers a rich tapestry of summer experiences that can’t be matched anywhere. From idyllic beaches and vibrant cities, to wonderful cuisines and exciting festivals – there are endless possibilities on this charismatic island. See our top 10 reasons to fall in love with Crete this summer below.\\n1. Spend a Day at the Beautiful Balos Beach\\nBalos beach was our favourite place in Crete and it’s easy to see why people fall in love with this destination. For starters, the view of the different bays on the hike down is priceless. We loved spending the day here – swimming in the pure turquoise waters and enjoying the wild natural beauty.\\nBreathtaking Scenes at Balos Beach © Sydney & Davis\\n2. Visit the Stunning Elafonissi Beach of Crete\\nElafonissi beach\\nis full of coves and clear shallow waters. Combine the turquoise waters here with the unique pink-coloured sand and you have one of the most stunning beaches in Crete. The beach is located around 2 hours drive from Chania, making it a fun road trip to get there.\\nPink Sands of Elafonissi Beach © Sydney & Davis\\n3. Wander the Quaint Streets of Heraklion\\nWe loved the twists and turns in the streets of Heraklion. It felt like we were in the epitome of a traditional Greek town. This is the largest city of Crete and one of the major urban centres in Greece. Highlights include visiting the Venetian Harbour, Knossos, Koules Fortress and more.\\n4. Watch the Sunset from Charming Rethymno\\nThere’s a cool vibe in\\nRethymno\\n, especially at night when restaurant-goers fill the marina. The town combines the charm and history of traditional Greek streets with proximity to a nice long beach. This makes it an attractive place to visit. It’s also a serene destination to watch the sunset.\\nWaiting for Sunset in the Charming Town of Rethymno © Sydney & Davis\\n5. Discover the St. Nicholas Church at Georgioupolis\\nThe path out to the church of St. Nicholas is super picturesque and can be a transformational experience. It was a beautiful spot to soak in the ocean surroundings and admire the classic white church architecture. St. Nicholas church is one of the most photographed places in Crete.\\nPath out to the Gorgeous Church of St. Nicholas © Sydney & Davis\\n6. Explore the Caves of Matala in Crete\\nThe Caves of Matala offer so much history. Indeed, hiking around the cliffside caves felt like we were going back in time. These rocks were carved out thousands of years ago in the steep cliffs that rise above the north side of the beach. Many believe that they are Roman or Early Christian tombs.\\n7. Take a Lovely Boat Ride to Loutro\\nUnfortunately, we didn’t get the chance to visit this gem but we heard so many amazing things about\\nLoutro\\n. It’s a peaceful village that offers stunning views and nothing more than a few hotels, taverns, mini-markets, blue houses, a pebble beach and fish taverns. It’s a magical little spot.\\n8. Swim at the Unique Seitan Limania Beach\\nSeitan Limania beach is probably the place you have seen the most photos of. The shape of the bay is totally unique (like a zig-zag) and the water is electric blue. We have never seen anything quite like this on a beach. We recommend spending at least one afternoon here, swimming and relaxing.\\nThe Incredible Seitan Limania Beach © Sydney & Davis\\n9. Stop at a Roadside Fruit Stand for a Snack\\nWe love tasting local produce wherever we go and the roadside fruit stands in Crete gave us this opportunity. The fruit on this island is ridiculously fresh. Make sure you try the oranges made in Maleme, cherries from Gerakari, bananas from Arvi and apples from Lassithi Plateau.\\nFruit Trees in the Villages of Crete © Sydney & Davis\\n10. Swim in the Ocean Everyday in Crete\\nOur last reason why you will fall in love with Crete is an obvious one. Swimming in the ocean is a typical summer experience and Crete is blessed with many beautiful beaches. The temperature gets quite high in summer so make sure you cool off whenever you can.\\nCrystal Clear Waters of Crete © Sydney & Davis\\nLife is a Beach in Crete © Sydney & Davis\\nBeautiful Moments at Rethymno\\nOur favourite memory from our trip was watching the sunset in Rethymno. We were out on the jetty, watching the sunset over the ocean. The sky was a fiery orange for about half an hour and then a small silver moon came sparkling out. Meanwhile, the nearby restaurants started to fill up.\\nWe listened to the atmosphere of the restaurants coming to life along the marina and watched the city light up as the sky grew darker. It was our last night in Crete – so we were doing our best to soak in the atmosphere.\\nGorgeous Sunset in the Charming Rethymno © Sydney & Davis\\nWhat you Need to Know Before you Go\\nThe first tip we can give is to try the local cuisine of Crete. Greek food is one of our favourites and we love the light Mediterranean flavours. From charcoal grilled vegetables to crisp Greek salads covered in herbs and olive oils. We would have this combo almost every night in Crete.\\nDefinitely rent a car so you can explore the largest Greek island by yourself. Depending on the amount of time you have, we recommend focusing on one side of the island at a time. We stayed on the western part of Crete but can’t wait to explore the east coast on our next trip.\\nBY SYDNEY & DAVIS\\nIG: @THE_ESCAPE_ARTISTS\\nWWW.THESCAPEARTISTS.COM\\nTags :\\nShare This Post :\\nMagnificent World\\nFor the Journey.\\n[email\\xa0protected]\\nLearn More\\nHome\\nDestinations\\nAbout\\nPrivacy Policy\\nNewsletter\\nEmail\\nSIGN UP\\nSign Up', 'url': 'https://www.magnificentworld.com/things-to-do-in-crete-summer/', 'summarised': 'Here is a summary of the article in 1000 words:\\n\\nSydney and Davis, a couple who met in college and got married after less than a year, share their love for travel and their experience visiting Crete, Greece.

However, there are lesser-known Greek dishes that are equally, if not more, delicious. And Crete is full of them!\\nSome consider the Cretan Diet even healthier than the Mediterranean diet. It includes the exclusive use of extra virgin olive oil, lots of fruits and seasonal vegetables, pulses, cereals, and just a little meat.\\nThe way locals cook on the island relies almost exclusively on local products and can be traced back to ancient times. Minoans knew and used olive oil and local wine like Cretans do in modern times.\\nHowever, several years of Turkish occupation also influenced the local cuisine. Many dishes can often be found (with quite similar names) in Turkish cuisine, starting with the simplest of all: coffee!\\nCretan traditions.\\nWhat Ingredients Will I Find in Cretan Dishes?\\nAre you eager to know more about the foods of Crete? These are some of the ingredients you can expect to find in the local cuisine.\\nVegetables\\nVegans and vegetarians will find paradise on Crete! There are so many dishes that include only vegetables that you’d be surprised. Many locals observe different fasting periods throughout the year, respecting the tradition of the Orthodox Church, but this does not mean that they eat boring salads or plain boiled veggies.\\nThe selection of vegetarian dishes is impressive. Besides, when the island was under Turkish occupation, meat was an expensive ingredient. Cretans survived cultivating their land; their diet has long been largely based on greens, vegetables, and fruits!\\nOther than the overwhelming variety of wild greens, the island is known for oranges, lemons, olives, pears, potatoes, and apples in the\\nLasithi Plateau\\n.\\nOn the southern coast, there are extensive plantations of tomatoes, avocados, kiwis, and bananas. Do try the Cretan banana! It’s smaller, tastier, and stunningly delicious. Traveling around the island, you will be delighted at the sweet smell of fig trees. There’s an incredible variety of grapes, melons, and watermelons, as well as apricots, peaches, and all kinds of nuts.\\nVegetables at the Public Market in Chania.\\nMeat\\nMutton is one of the local favorites. It’s usually served with wild greens or salads, stewed onions, or baked potatoes. Pork is also commonly served, and the Cretans love several dishes, including\\napaki\\nand the well-known village sausages.\\nGoat is another staple on the island. It can be cooked on the spit, poached with rice (pilaff), or, for a more sophisticated touch, sprinkled with honey or\\npetimezi\\n(an ancient grape syrup still used on the island).\\nAntikristo (lamb) from Anogia, Rethymnon.\\nFish\\nThe island has a strong mountain character, so many visitors are surprised to find that its staples are more goat than fish and more mutton than octopus—yes, despite being an island! However, locals do eat fish, often served with vegetables or cooked in soups.\\nFish is a favorite during important Catholic celebrations, but it is not consumed during the long fasting periods in the religious calendar.\\nGavros\\nis a common dish on the island.\\n>> Traveling to Crete soon? Check these\\nrookie mistakes you want to avoid making on the island\\n.\\nCheese\\nCheese is another staple food in Crete. It is produced all over the island, and some varieties vary from region to region. For instance, if you compare the savory\\nmyzithra\\ncheese produced in Chania to the sweet, delicate one served in Lasithi, you’ll believe you’re tasting two completely different varieties of cheese.\\nKefalotyri\\nhas been produced on the island for centuries, and buying it in Chania or the Lasithi Plateau can make all the difference. Other cheeses include the\\nCretan Graviera\\n, made with milk from goats and sheep,\\nAnthotyros\\n,\\nTyrozouli\\nfrom Psiloritis, and\\nTiromalama\\n(\\nMalaka\\ncheese, if you allow the expression).\\nPichtogalo\\n(or\\nGalomyzithra\\n) from Chania is a delicious product of appellation of origin.\\nCheese varieties.\\nStaka\\nFinally, a word must be spent on\\nstaka\\n(στάκα). This is a Cretan sauce (more of a\\nroux\\n), typical of our island’s cuisine, that locals prepare by cooking\\xa0sheep’s milk\\xa0cream over a low flame with\\xa0wheat flour\\xa0or\\xa0starch.\\nStaka is generally eaten warm as a spread. You can dip bread in it, or it can be served over fried potatoes or fried eggs.\\nThe fatty part that separates from the staka during the cooking process forms\\nstakovoutyro\\n, the staka butter, sometimes used in Cretan\\npiláfi\\n, a delicious rice commonly served at weddings. Staka is a staple Cretan dish and a must-try on the island.\\nBread and\\nstaka\\n.\\nThe King of Cretan Food: Olive Oil\\nExtra virgin, fragrant, spicy, walnutty… You can create as many adjectives as you wish to describe the fantastic characteristics of the local olive oil.\\nThe island, Greece’s second olive oil producer, is home to two different olive varieties:\\nkoroneiki\\nand\\ntsounato\\n.

The same happens for lunch; almost nobody sits at a table before 1, or even 2 p.m. Don’t worry—restaurants are aware that this is not the case in the rest of the world, so you’ll be able to have a dining table ready at 6 or 7 p.m.\\nDon’t be surprised if those sitting beside you still enjoy their cold coffee. Yes, you guessed right, those are most probably Cretans!\\nMany Cretans prefer to have just one main meal per day, at midday, while at night, they tend to dine light, either with a selection of\\nmezedes\\nor with what might have remained from the day’s main meal. This is not the case for everyone, but it’s not uncommon.\\nCretan traditions (Easter grill).\\n>> Read about\\nStreet food in Chania\\n.\\nWhat to Eat: Staple Dishes from Crete\\nWe’re almost there. I know this is the real reason why you opened this article, but I didn’t want to offer a simple list of dishes to try without first introducing you to the basic secrets of Cretan gastronomy.\\nSo now yes, if you want to explore the unique Cretan cuisine and its dishes, here are 20 of the best local specialties.\\nTraditional cooking in Crete.\\nDakos\\nWhen you visit a restaurant or tavern in Crete or anywhere in Greece, you always have the option to start with appetizers until the main dish comes.\\nDakos\\nis one such appetizer, or “\\nmeze\\n” as commonly called in Greek. Although this dish is a salad, it relates very much to a pizza or Italian bruschetta.\\nThis is because there are chopped tomatoes, olives, and crumbled\\nfeta\\nor\\nmizithra\\ncheese on top of a slice of dried bread or barley rusk, locally known as\\npaximadia\\nwhich has been softened with plenty of extra virgin olive oil. In addition, herbs such as oregano and pepper give the plate an extra flavor. All you have to do to enjoy this dish is to order\\nDakos\\nin any restaurant or tavern in Crete.\\nDakos.\\nGamopilafo\\nGamopilafo\\nis a main dish consisting of rice cooked in meat and poultry broth. The name translates to “rice of the wedding”. Traditionally,\\nGamopilafo\\nis the primary dish in every wedding feast in Crete, mostly in west Crete. It became prevalent between the 17th and 19th centuries when owning rice, meat, and poultry came together with social status.\\nHence, the family hosting the feast chose to prepare\\nGamopilafo\\nwhich needed all three of these ingredients. In other words, this Cretan dish was a way to demonstrate the family’s wealth and fertility to the parents-in-law and the local society.\\nGamopilafo: Wedding pilaf with Greek yogurt and meat.\\nCooking gamopilafo at a wedding.\\nAntikristo\\nIf you are a meat lover, you have to try\\nAntikristo\\n. This name does not refer to a specific kind of meat. Rather, it signifies a special cooking method that means “across the fire”. This old technique is popular among the population in the mountain areas of Crete, where lamb breeding is the main source of income.\\nShepherds use this cooking method to prepare their meat. They place the amb on a round metal rail across a large fire, 10 to 20 centimeters away from the flames, and then let the meat get ready. Although this cooking method can take time, the taste is unique and the result is worth waiting for.\\nAntikristo in Therissos, Chania.\\nKleftiko\\nThere has never been such a popular but at the same time mysterious dish as Kleftiko. This is because, historically, you could never really know what\\nKleftiko\\nconsists of. This ambiguity derives from its name and history.\\nKleftiko\\nmeans “stolen”.\\nA few hundred years ago, pirates used to raid Greek villages and use the stolen food to prepare meals on their ships. It was a mix of all the food which the pirates stole. They called it\\nKleftiko\\nand its legacy is still evident today, as you can find the dish in many Cretan restaurants.\\nAlthough there are many versions, the main Cretan variation consists of a meat, vegetables, and potatoes wrapped in parchment paper and slowly cooked in the oven (if wooden oven, even better!)\\nKleftiko.\\nPatsas\\nPatsas\\nis another Cretan and Greek dish with a rich history. It comes from the\\nMelanos Zomos\\n(black soup) of antiquity. Ancient Cretans used to boil animal intestines with hooves to have a quick but energetic dish.This meal was ideal for warfare as the hooves and guts were light enough to carry without weighing the soldiers down.\\nToday,\\nPatsas\\nstill consists of veal hoovers, tripes, and intestines, all boiled together. Old folks on the island eat this soup usually in the morning for breakfast or as an appetizer before the main meal. Because of its high protein value and medicinal effects, you can also use\\nPatsas\\nas an antidote against hangovers. If you are looking for any extra reason to party in Crete, here you are!\\nPatsas.\\nChaniotiko Boureki\\nBoureki\\nis a classic Cretan pie that consists mainly of potatoes and zucchini. Although many restaurants serve it with an outer layer of dough, Chania Boureki, which is considered the traditional version, does not include the dough layer. It is a delicious vegetarian pie that you can eat for breakfast, brunch, or any other quick meal throughout the day.\\nApart from potatoes and zucchini, you will also taste the flavor of mizithra and fresh mint. Of course, olive oil is always present in every pie. This is my absolute favorite dish on the island!\\nAuthentic Chaniotiko Boureki (photo by Anna M. Kambouraki).\\nFried Snails (Kohli Bourbouristi)\\nIf you are looking for something special, fried snails could be an unexpectedly tasty and unique dish. In many parts of Crete, snails are pan-fried in their shells, usually in hefty amounts of olive oil or on a bed of salt. Cooks usually add vinegar and different herbs such as rosemary or parsley to give an extra flavor to the dish.\\nYou can eat the snails with toothpicks to take the meat parts out of the shells. If you are brave enough to do that, of course! Make sure you also order a glass of ouzo or raki if you want to enjoy this delicate dish.\\nKohli Bourbouristi.\\nOctopus with Chopped Pasta (Xtapodi me Makaronia)\\nA popular Cretan meal, usually made during the fasting period before Greek Easter, is the octopus with chopped pasta. It is a dish that you can find in many restaurants and taverns all around Crete.\\nYou do not need to wait to get to Crete to taste that dish. It takes less than an hour to prepare and cook it. All you need is some fresh octopus, onions, olive oil, wine, herbs, chopped pasta, and trimmed tomatoes.\\nYou can boil the octopus and prepare the pasta like you always do. Just remember to use the juice of the octopus to boil the pasta.\\nPasta with octopus.\\nSarikopitakia – Kalitsounia\\nSarikopitakia are small fried cheesy pastries that you can eat during breakfast or any other time as a quick snack. These small pies may also come as a dessert topped with honey and cinnamon in many Cretan restaurants. Or they can also be a savory starter when filled with local greens, cheese, or spinach.\\nIn fact, there are many different versions of kalitsounia or saropitakia, depending on where they’re made. In the Heraklion region, for instance, they can also be made with\\ntsoureki\\ndough (similar to brioche pastry) and filled with myzithra.\\nThe name comes from the Turkish word “\\nSariki\\n” which means\\nturban\\nand explains the spiral shapes of these mini pastries.\\nSariki\\nalso refers to a traditional headdress worn by Cretan men during celebrations. If you happen to find that dessert in a Cretan restaurant, don’t miss the opportunity to order and taste this unique specialty.\\nKalitsounia with greens.\\nKalitsounia from Therisos (Chania)\\nKalitsounia from Anogia (Rethymnon).\\nKalitsounia from Malevizi (Heraklion).\\nCretan Salad\\nIf you do not want to wait until you get to Crete and taste the local\\nDakos\\n, you can make a Cretan salad (Krititki Salata) from ingredients you can find in your local grocery store. You can combine tomato, cucumber, onion, purslane, and barley rusk in a big bowl.\\nWell, that might be the official recipe, the truth is that Cretan salads will include whatever fresh ingredient you have, and it will always be delicious!\\nAdd virgin olive oil if you have it, then toss and mix everything. Finally, arrange it on a plate, top it with myzithra cheese, and drizzle it with Greek oregano. And ready to taste! This salad is served in many restaurants and taverns in Crete and is one of the most important dishes in a typical family lunch.\\nCretan Salad.\\nSfakian Pie\\nSfakian pie or\\nSfakiani Pita\\nis a crepe-thin pie that you can find in the region of Sfakia in Crete. It is stuffed with soft cheese making it one of the most delicious and juicy pies in the whole of Greece if not the world.\\nIts ingredients include flour, mizithra, olive oil, and raki. You can eat it as a snack, starter, or dessert. You decide. Apart from the local taverns and stores in the region, there is an annual event called the Sfakian Pie Festival that takes place every August in the mountain village of Sfakia. There, you have the opportunity to indulge in one of the most delicious gastronomic festivals in the entirety of Crete.\\nSfakian Pie.\\nGardoumia\\nFor all the meat lovers out there, a visit to Crete would be incomplete if you don’t try the local\\nAddirittura Gardoumia\\n, or simply\\nGardoumia\\n. This dish is a special meze made from lamb intestines.\\nTraditionally, the population in the mountainous areas of Crete considers this dish one of the most luxurious and delicious plates they can have.\\nThey save the lamb guts in low temperatures- fridges if they have them- and take them out only for special occasions, such as Christmas, Easter, or weddings.\\nIn general,\\nGardoumia\\nis cooked in three phases: first in a pot to fry it, then on the coals, and finally in the oven. The final result is simply exquisite.\\nGardoumia.\\nStamnagathi\\xa0(with Local Lamb)\\nLamb with\\nStamnagathi\\nis what it sounds: lamb served with\\nstamnagathi\\n, a local wild green very similar to chicory. Although the dish is slightly bitter due to the wild plant, it still has an enjoyable taste, especially if the lamb is coming from the local shepherds.\\nLamb is usually boiled and served with olive oil and lemon. If you are a meat lover, you want to taste this specialty. There is no way around it.\\nWild greens from Crete.\\nTsigariasto\\nAnother meat dish original to Crete is\\nTsigariasto\\n. Made from goat or lamb, this delicious plate is cooked at very low temperatures for more than a few hours. Although it may take quite some time to prepare, the wait is certainly worth it.\\nHistorically, and especially during the Ottoman years, locals used the delicious meat of the Cretan wild goat, also known as\\nAgrimi\\n(although locals love to call it Kri-Kri) to make this Cretan specialty.\\nAlthough\\nAgrimi\\nis now a protected species, the quality of the meat selected is always high. Be prepared for some of the finest meat dishes in Crete.\\nTsigariasto.\\nMarathopita\\nMarathopita\\nis a delicious pie made in Crete and is available all over the island. Its ingredients include spinach, sorrel, and fresh onion. Some housewives make it with fennel though.\\nThe pie is also rich in fennel which adds an extra sense of freshness and flavor. All in all, it is a convenient choice for a takeaway snack or breakfast if you visit a local bakery. Or you can order it as an appetizar in a restaurant.\\nMarathopita.\\nPaximadi\\nIf you are sick and tired of the traditional bread, then you have to try\\nPaximadi\\n, also known as rusks. These small but hard pieces of bread are repeatedly cooked to become some of the finest types of bread you will ever taste.\\nAlthough it may be hard to cut, you can soften it with water or olive oil before you serve it. It also has the added benefit that it can last for months in the pantry. Hence, you don’t need to worry about getting fresh bread every day. Very handy in emergency cases when you run out of fresh bread.\\nCretan rusk.\\nKatsiki (Baby Goat) with Potatoes and Chestnuts\\nOne of the most delicious things you can try in the region of Chania is chestnuts. The region of Chania is home to Elos, the so-called\\nchestnut village of Crete\\n,\\nThis little village is located at the end of the Topolia Gorge, on the way to\\nElafonisi Beach\\nand it is a must-stop place if you are interested in trying the most authentic mountain dishes on the island.\\nBaby goat (kid) with baked chestnuts and potatoes is one of the typical delicacies you can try in one of the three restaurants in the village. And it is truly delicious!\\nBaby goat in the oven with chestnuts and potatoes (\\nKatsiki me kastana kai patates\\n).\\nAnthous (Stuffed zucchini flowers)\\nEverybody is familiar with stuffed vine leaves, but in Crete, especially during the summer, zucchini flowers stuffed with rice, aromatic herbs, lemon juice, and a few drops of olive oil, fried in abundant olive oil are a common and super delicious\\norektikà (starter)\\nthat is served with a big side portion of Greek yogurt.\\nThis is a fresh dish, perfect to start any lunch or dinner, and, if well seasoned with freshly-cut herbs including dill and mint, is simply perfect!\\nAnthi: Fried zucchini flowers stuffed with rice and herbs, olive oil, and lemon.\\nSoupià Stuffed with Myzithra Cheese\\nAnother amazing dish, terrific on our hot summer nights, is this stunning seafood dish that features fresh cuttlefish stuffed with local soft goat cheese. Although the combination might sound weird, if you try it you will fall in love.\\nBest place to try this? Bourbos Kafenio, in the\\nSplantzia neighborhood (I talk about them here)\\n, in the\\nold town of Chania\\n. Sprinkle with some drops of fresh lemon juice and thank me later!\\nStuffed cuttlefish.\\nXoriatiko Loukaniko\\nOne more simple traditional dish that locals love to order as a starter is the so-called village sausage (\\nxoriatiko loukaniko\\n).\\nThese sausages are usually slightly smoked, which makes their taste incredibly delicious. They are grilled and often served with a small side dish of fried potatoes.If you have kids that are not really happy to try new flavors, this dish will make both the children and the parents happy!\\nVillage sausages (\\nXoriatiki Loukanika\\n).\\nSpoon Sweets\\nSpoon sweets are delicious sweet preserves, served in a spoon as a gesture of hospitality in many areas of Greece. Yet, Crete has its traditions and exquisite delicacies when it comes to those desserts.\\nYou can find spoon sweets made from cherry, peach, orange, and many other fresh, sour, and bitter fruits here. In addition, some also use vegetables to create their special spoon sweets. Be it tomato, pumpkin, or even cucumber.\\nNot only can you order these desserts from restaurants and taverns alike in Crete, but you can also buy them in large quantities from any bakery or candy store.\\nSpoon sweets.\\n>> Want to try making a typical Cretan Grape Spoon Sweet?\\nCheck out this traditional recipe!\\nLychnarakia\\nIf you happen to be in Crete around Greek Easter, you will notice the locals eating\\nKalitsounia\\nall the time, normally known as\\nLychnarakia\\nin Crete (while\\nKalitsounia\\nis mostly used for similar small savory pies). From breakfast or snack to brunch or a side sweet to sever with the coffee.\\nThese pastries are carefully handmade and shaped into tiny cups filled with sweet cheese. Depending on the region and time of your visit, the type of cheese may vary. However, the final result is always tasty.\\nAnd it is so all year since you can find these even outside Easter. Local bakeries fry or bake them all year round. Some of them are also sprinkled with cinnamon or sesame seeds. Yummy!\\nLychnarakia.\\nLoukoumades\\nAlthough\\nLoukoumades\\ncan be found almost everywhere in Greece, Crete has their specialties and hidden recipes. There are as many types and tastes of\\nLoukoumades\\nas there are stores that cook them. Even the tiniest change in the recipe, proportions, or procedure used can bring completely different results.\\nHowever, these fried doughs always come together with ice cream, nuts, or Cretan honey. Hence, this is also a unique opportunity to try the Cretan thyme honey or local ice cream made with milk from sheep.\\nIf you are lucky,\\nLoukoumades\\nmay be the “on-the-house” dessert (known as\\nkerasma\\n) you will have during dinner in one of the Cretan restaurants you will visit. If that is the case, you are the chosen one! Rejoice and enjoy!\\nLoukoumades.\\nTsikoudia (Raki)\\nLast but not least, when you come to Crete, you have to try tsikoudia. If you don’t, here you have an extra reason to come back. Fair enough, raki is not a plate or a snack. It is however the most popular alcoholic beverage in Crete.\\nThere is a rumor that drinking a small glass of\\nraki\\nevery morning once you wake up can bring longevity. If you are curious to know how Cretans make this famous beverage, you have to visit one of the hundreds of local wineries in Crete.\\nTo not spoil the surprise, get ready to see and experience firsthand how tasteful and healthy the so-called “leftovers” of the wine-making process can be.\\xa0And for those with a sweet tooth,\\nrakomelo\\n, – which is\\nraki\\nwith local honey – is a must-try.\\n>> Have you ever tried Cretan raki?\\nRead more here\\n.\\nRaki.\\nWhat to Drink: Wine Pairing in Crete\\nAre you wondering what you can drink when sampling such delicious dishes?

Cretan Cheeses\\nIt seems that almost every Cretan village has its own signature cheese. They are usually made from sheep or goat’s milk, or a combination of both and each cheese variety has its local interpretation. Of the legion of delicious cheeses, look for graviera, a harder cheese that’s sweeter when new, but nutty and flavourful after aging. Soft, creamy cheeses, abound like pichtogalo Chanion, which has AOC protection, or myzithra, a young whey cheese with a lovely mild taste.\\n\\n2. Dakos\\nThe ever-popular dakos is known by regional names throughout Crete…some call it koukouvagia (literally ‘owl’); in the east they call it kouloukopsomo (literally ‘puppy bread’). What is it? A fantastic Greek meze or salad reminiscent of bruschetta, but based on barley rusks or paximadi, not on bread. The rusks are lightly soaked in water or olive oil to soften them, and then they are topped with grated fresh tomato and myzithra, the creamy sheep or goat’s milk cheese. They are then drizzled with Cretan virgin olive oil and dusted with salt, oregano, pepper.\\n\\n3. Fried snails (Chochlioi boubouristi)\\nIt’s not only the French who treat snails as a delicacy. In fact, snails have been eaten for millennia. In the Cretan dialect cochlios means snail, and in this dish they are fried with flour and hot olive oil in a pan, then doused with wine (or vinegar), and voila, ready to serve. Some like to add a dash of wild rosemary. Locally, women collect the snails by hand and the creatures are cooked up live.\\n\\n4. Cretan Cheese Pies (Kaltsounia)\\nThese small pies may look like the multitude of cheese pies you’ll encounter throughout Greece, but these are unique! To start, handmade pastry dough is a must, usually shaped into tiny cups. The fillings vary – every region and often each household has its favourite. They tend toward the sweet, and count on any number of those luscious Cretan cheeses, like myzithra or malaka, but not feta. We like the ones that incorporate a hint of rosewater. The final touch is Cretan honey on the top, making the pies a heady combination of sweet and savoury.\\n\\n5. Lamb with stamnagathi\\nAs with most Greek foods, Cretans have their own take on lamb. Their version incorporates stamnagathi, a wild green that has become trendy of late, and features on many top-end restaurant menus. The Cretan lamb is sautéed in hot olive oil and oregano accompanied with the stamnagathi green and the well-known avgolemono (egg and lemon-based) sauce, or, more simply, a squeeze of fresh lemon.\\n\\n6. Gamopilafo\\nAs the name hints (gamos means ‘wedding’ in Greek) this rice dish is offered at traditional Cretan weddings. These days you will find it not only when the whole village is celebrating nuptials in the town square, but also in many Cretan tavernas. Like a deluxe risotto, it is prepared in a rich meat broth that you make from a lengthy simmering of goat, lamb or rooster. Then you incorporate a dash of lemon juice and liberal amounts of stakovoutiro – this is a butter created from the creamy skin that forms on the top of boiled fresh goat's milk and is turned into a roux. It is the crème de la crème!\\n\\n7. Mountain Bulbs (Askordoulakous)\\nPart of the magic of Cretan food are the ingredients gathered from hillsides and around villages. Askordoulakous are the bulbs of a wild green, and Cretans gather bulbs and eat them as a fresh salad, dressed with oil and vinegar or lemon. They also pickle them, or stew them with local olive oil, vinegar and flour. The delicate white blossoms of the green are also edible, simply boiled or used in other dishes.\\n\\n8. Smoked Pork (Hirina apakia)\\nNot an easy one to recreate outside of Greece, this dish of succulent smoked pork, is made in a multi-day process. First, strips of pork are marinated in vinegar for several days. Then a fire is made using local herbs - sage, bay, rosemary - and the meat is hung above it to smoke. The smoke is continuously stoked to keep the herby aroma infusing the meat. The final product tastes of the fresh herbs and can be served later, cold, in thin slices.\\n\\n9. Sfakia pies (Sfakianes pites)\\nThese yummy pies hale from southern Crete, from a mountainous coastal region called Sfakia. At a glance, these treats look like pancakes, but beyond the flour, the dough contains local olive oil, and the infamous Cretan liquor, raki. Then, any number of the various Cretan fresh, soft, white goat or sheep’s milk cheeses like myzithra or pichtogalo Chanion are incorporated into the centre of the pie. Fried with only a light brushing of olive oil, they are eaten with a drizzling of thyme or heather honey.\\n\\n10. Cretan Brandy (Raki or Tsikoudia)\\nIn the fall, after the grape harvest, you will find villagers all around Crete carefully tending open fires under copper stills. They are making raki, the welcome pomace brandy distilled from grapes, which you will find served in every Cretan taverna and kafeneio (coffee house). The local version of tsipouro (which you find throughout the rest of Greece), raki is called tsikoudia in parts of Crete, and is drunk from shot glasses, with no water added. Not to be confused with ouzo, raki has no anise or any other herbs. People usually pair their raki with mezes, olives or barley rusks and drink it neat (sketo)!\", 'url': 'https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/travel/europe/top-10-foods-try-crete', 'summarised': None}]}})\n",

      "\n",
      "Here is the cleaned-up text, removing unnecessary preamble and navigation:\n",
      "\n",
      "10 Cretan dishes to try\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Cretan Cheeses\n",
      "It seems that almost every Cretan village has its own signature cheese. They are usually made from sheep or goat’s milk, or a combination of both and each cheese variety has its local interpretation. Of the legion of delicious cheeses, look for graviera, a harder cheese that’s sweeter when new, but nutty and flavourful after aging. Soft, creamy cheeses, abound like pichtogalo Chanion, which has AOC protection, or myzithra, a young whey cheese with a lovely mild taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Dakos\n",
      "The ever-popular dakos is known by regional names throughout Crete…some call it koukouvagia (literally ‘owl’); in the east they call it kouloukopsomo (literally ‘puppy bread’). What is it? A fantastic Greek meze or salad reminiscent of bruschetta, but based on barley rusks or paximadi, not on bread. The rusks are lightly soaked in water or olive oil to soften them, and then they are topped with grated fresh tomato and myzithra, the creamy sheep or goat’s milk cheese. They are then drizzled with Cretan virgin olive oil and dusted with salt, oregano, pepper.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Fried snails (Chochlioi boubouristi)\n",
      "It’s not only the French who treat snails as a delicacy. In fact, snails have been eaten for millennia. In the Cretan dialect cochlios means snail, and in this dish they are fried with flour and hot olive oil in a pan, then doused with wine (or vinegar), and voila, ready to serve. Some like to add a dash of wild rosemary. Locally, women collect the snails by hand and the creatures are cooked up live.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Cretan Cheese Pies (Kaltsounia)\n",
      "These small pies may look like the multitude of cheese pies you’ll encounter throughout Greece, but these are unique! To start, handmade pastry dough is a must, usually shaped into tiny cups. The fillings vary – every region and often each household has its favourite. They tend toward the sweet, and count on any number of those luscious Cretan cheeses, like myzithra or malaka, but not feta. We like the ones that incorporate a hint of rosewater. The final touch is Cretan honey on the top, making the pies a heady combination of sweet and savoury.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Lamb with stamnagathi\n",
      "As with most Greek foods, Cretans have their own take on lamb. Their version incorporates stamnagathi, a wild green that has become trendy of late, and features on many top-end restaurant menus. The Cretan lamb is sautéed in hot olive oil and oregano accompanied with the stamnagathi green and the well-known avgolemono (egg and lemon-based) sauce, or, more simply, a squeeze of fresh lemon.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Gamopilafo\n",
      "As the name hints (gamos means ‘wedding’ in Greek) this rice dish is offered at traditional Cretan weddings. These days you will find it not only when the whole village is celebrating nuptials in the town square, but also in many Cretan tavernas. Like a deluxe risotto, it is prepared in a rich meat broth that you make from a lengthy simmering of goat, lamb or rooster. Then you incorporate a dash of lemon juice and liberal amounts of stakovoutiro – this is a butter created from the creamy skin that forms on the top of boiled fresh goat's milk and is turned into a roux. It is the crème de la crème!\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Mountain Bulbs (Askordoulakous)\n",
      "Part of the magic of Cretan food are the ingredients gathered from hillsides and around villages. Askordoulakous are the bulbs of a wild green, and Cretans gather bulbs and eat them as a fresh salad, dressed with oil and vinegar or lemon. They also pickle them, or stew them with local olive oil, vinegar and flour. The delicate white blossoms of the green are also edible, simply boiled or used in other dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Smoked Pork (Hirina apakia)\n",
      "Not an easy one to recreate outside of Greece, this dish of succulent smoked pork, is made in a multi-day process. First, strips of pork are marinated in vinegar for several days. Then a fire is made using local herbs - sage, bay, rosemary - and the meat is hung above it to smoke. The smoke is continuously stoked to keep the herby aroma infusing the meat. The final product tastes of the fresh herbs and can be served later, cold, in thin slices.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Sfakia pies (Sfakianes pites)\n",
      "These yummy pies hale from southern Crete, from a mountainous coastal region called Sfakia. At a glance, these treats look like pancakes, but beyond the flour, the dough contains local olive oil, and the infamous Cretan liquor, raki. Then, any number of the various Cretan fresh, soft, white goat or sheep’s milk cheeses like myzithra or pichtogalo Chanion are incorporated into the centre of the pie. Fried with only a light brushing of olive oil, they are eaten with a drizzling of thyme or heather honey.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Cretan Brandy (Raki or Tsikoudia)\n",
      "In the fall, after the grape harvest, you will find villagers all around Crete carefully tending open fires under copper stills. They are making raki, the welcome pomace brandy distilled from grapes, which you will find served in every Cretan taverna and kafeneio (coffee house). The local version of tsipouro (which you find throughout the rest of Greece), raki is called tsikoudia in parts of Crete, and is drunk from shot glasses, with no water added. Not to be confused with ouzo, raki has no anise or any other herbs. People usually pair their raki with mezes, olives or barley rusks and drink it neat (sketo)!\n",

This ensures advertisers get accurate data on ad performance and reach, reducing fraud and increasing ROI. Marketers can explore blockchain-based platforms to create more efficient and transparent advertising campaigns.\n",
      "*   **Virtual Reality (VR) & Augmented Reality (AR)**: VR and AR technologies will enable brands to offer immersive experiences that engage consumers in new ways. For instance, VR can be used for virtual product trials or interactive storytelling, while AR can enhance real-world interactions with digital overlays. Marketers should start experimenting with these technologies now by creating pilot projects to understand their potential impact on customer engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Consumer Behavior Shifts\n",

Marketers must ensure compliance by implementing robust data management practices, obtaining explicit consent from users for data collection and usage, and providing clear opt-out options.\n",
      "*   **Advertising Transparency**: Regulations may require greater transparency in advertising practices to combat issues like ad fraud and misleading claims. This could involve mandatory disclosures about the use of AI-generated content or blockchain-based transactions in advertisements.\n",
      "\n",

It’s an Easy Choice (PLUS: the Perfect 5 Day Crete Itinerary)\\nEurope\\n|\\nGreece\\n|\\nRTW 9 1/2 - The Moscow to the Med Edition\\nGreece’s largest island has airports in both Heraklion and Chania so which is better? Here’s my pick, plus how to spend 5 epic days on Crete.\\n“\\nDecision time. What’s it going to be, Heraklion or Chania?”\\nI queried my favorite travel accomplice, Shannon, as we waited to board our flight from\\nRiga, Latvia\\nto\\nVilnius, Lithuania\\n.\\n“\\nOr Rethymno or Agios Nikolaos?\\n” she countered, with an exasperated sigh.\\nThis exchange mirrored all previous deliberations over where to call home on our upcoming visit to Crete Greece – the country’s largest island.\\nWe were smack in the middle of a\\n30-day, 15-stop European summer adventure\\nand if we didn’t end this dance of procrastination soon, we’d be landing in Crete homeless.\\nIn a few days, our cheap-o Ryan Air flight from\\nSardinia\\n(via Rome) would land in Chania, on the western end of the island. Logic dictated spending (at least) the first night there.\\nBut our outbound flight 5 days later would depart from the eastern city of Heraklion.\\nFurther complicating our decision? There is plenty to see in between.\\nThus, the Cretan Dilemma…Heraklion or Chania?\\nUsually, picking the right hotel is one of my biggest hurdles in travel planning.\\nNote:\\nThis post may contain affiliate links. If you choose to book through these links, I receive a small commission, which I will undoubtedly blow on more flights (it’s a vicious cycle).\\xa0 All of this internet voodoo takes place at no additional cost to you.\\nBut with Crete, you must first choose between beachy resort areas (Agios Nikolaos, Elounda), charming harbor towns (Chania, Rethymno), or a history-rich city port (Heraklion).\\nEast or West. Big or small. Beach, history, or nightlife?\\nFinally, while searching Chania hotels on\\nBooking.com\\n, we found a great rate on a small, basic hotel in a terrific location near the harbor. It seemed like a sign, so we booked it for the first two nights.\\nWe decided to throw caution to the wind and figure out the rest when we arrived.\\nHere’s how it went…\\nPlanning a trip to Greece in 2025?\\nFrom the most spectacular beaches to the tastiest treats to try, here’s everything you need to know to plan your trip to the Greek Islands!\\nThe Ultimate Guide to the Greek Islands!\\nHow we spent our 5 days on Crete\\nDon’t have time to read the full post? (You should, it’s great!) Here’s our 5-day Crete itinerary in a nutshell:\\nArrival in Chania (swoon), decide to spend all 5 nights there.\\nDay Trip to Elafonisi Beach from Chania.\\nDay Trip to Gramvousa and Balos Lagoon from Chania\\n.\\nExplore Chania and take a glass-bottom boat trip.\\nEarly bus to Heraklion and an afternoon exploring Knossos.\\nBut read on for all the juicy details and whether spending all 5 nights in Chania turned out to be the right decision.\\nWhat Makes Crete Unique?\\nFor centuries the natural beauty of Crete was at the mercy of pirate fleets and the conquests of formidable Mediterranean powers. The Greeks, Romans, Venetians, and Turks each left their cultural mark on the island.\\nAs a result of this confluence of cultures, Crete evolved a national identity that is entirely unique from the rest of Greece.\\nEven today, when the locals refer to their traditional dishes or local products like olive oil or honey, it’s always as “\\nCretan\\n,” never Greek. In fact, it wasn’t until 1913 that Crete formally joined with Greece.\\nToday, it’s one of Greece’s most popular islands to visit and makes my list as one of\\nThe 10 Best Greek Islands to Visit This Summer\\n.\\nHow to get to Crete – flight or ferry?\\nIf you’re coming from Athens, there are plenty of options for both ferries and flights.\\nBut before you depart Athens…\\nIf this is your first trip to Greece, you absolutely must spend at least a few days exploring the city’s incredible historic sights. I know, I know, the Greek Islands are enticing. But Athens is\\nliterally\\nthe birthplace of Western civilization. And that’s pretty darn impressive. If time is short, here’s a foolproof one-day itinerary:\\nHow to Spend 24 Hours in Athens\\nIf you’re coming from mainland Europe, you’ll find a number of direct flight options (like we did) into Crete.\\nFrom Athens, a quick flight makes the most sense due to Crete’s distance from the mainland. But if you prefer a ferry, the ride will take you anywhere from 6-9 hours with several stops along the way.\\nTip:\\nThe absolute best site for booking ferries in Greece is\\nFerryHopper.com.\\nWith the basics covered, let’s get back to how we allocated our 5 day itinerary for Crete.\\nDay 1. Love at First Sight in Chania\\nAfter landing at the Chania airport, we grab a taxi to our hotel.\\nOur bargain hotel pick in Chania turns out to be a genius decision. Shannon and I immediately fall in love with the quaint harbor town of Chania the minute we see it (ultimately deciding to spend our entire 5 days in Crete there).\\nI didn’t think anything could top my previous Greek Islands favorite,\\nMykonos\\n, but Chania just might come close.\\nOur room at\\nNikolas Rooms\\nis small and very basic. However, the location is superb, with a lovely view of the town square and church and just steps away from the harbor…all for about $100 a night.\\nChania’s charming harbor\\nChania is our base for the first two nights of our 5 days in Crete, but the question remains. Where to stay for our last three nights?\\nAnd more importantly, what are the best things to do in Crete to fill our days? We spend the rest of Day 1 investigating the best things to do near Chania.\\nThe Top 2 Things To Do Near Chania\\nFor a little professional guidance, we head straight to the local travel office for a map and some local advice. The office is extremely helpful and we quickly nail down the two main things we want to do while on the western end of the island:\\nVisit the pink sands of Elafonisi Beach\\nTake a day trip to Gramvousa and Balos islands\\nThe bus to Elafonisi departs and returns at two set times each day. Judging the morning time a bit aggressive for a proper Greek island holiday, we opt to rent a car for tomorrow to drive ourselves.\\nTip:\\nWhen it comes to booking rental cars in Europe,\\nDiscover\\nCars.com\\nis my go-to site:\\nMY Pick\\nDiscover Cars\\nMy favorite rental car booking site to use all over the world. No hidden costs, free cancellation, and 24/7 customer support.\\nfind my Perfect Car\\nThen, we book the standard ferry boat trip to Gramvousa and Balos for the following day.\\nThe Balos day trip means we’ll be gone all of our third day, so it makes sense to stay put at Nikolas Rooms for a third night.\\nThree nights down, two more to go.\\nSidebar:\\nWe were also interested in taking a day trip over to the island of\\nSantorini\\nbut quickly learned that one is much easier to tackle from Heraklion (one point for staying in Heraklion over Chania).\\nRead More:\\n3 Things to Know About a Crete to Santorini Day Trip\\nWe’ll save that for another time, there’s plenty to see on this side of the island.\\nDay 2. A Day Trip to Elafonisi Beach\\nThe plan for our first full day in Crete:\\n1 – Make the 90-minute drive across the mountainous center of the island to Elafonisi Beach on the southwest corner\\n2 – Maximize our 1-day car rental by checking out the picturesque harbor of Rethymno to see if it is any better than Chania (which doesn’t seem possible).\\nThe drive to Elafonissi through the mountains\\nDriving on the Island of Crete\\nWe pick up our rental car at\\nCar Rental Crete\\nby\\nRental Center Crete\\nat a respectable 9:00am to begin our day of island adventure.\\nOnce on the road, the drive involves several white-knuckle, winding roads through the mountains. It takes nearly two hours to get to Elafonisi, instead of the estimated 90 minutes.\\nPink Beach Paradise at Elafonisi Beach\\nBut it is definitely worth the ambitious drive, Elafonisi is absolutely\\nstunning\\n.\\nRead More:\\nThis Remote Greek Beach is the Best in the World (& You’ve Never Heard of It)\\nCrete’s pink sand beaches\\nMore than just a simple beach, Elafonisi actually a peninsula of several beaches. At various tides, it even becomes its own island. The shallow, sparkling turquoise sea extends at knee-high depth for what seems like miles.\\nIt brings to mind some of my favorite endless lagoons in the South Pacific, like\\nAitutaki\\nand\\nMoorea\\n. It is just fantastic.\\nThe pink sands of Elafonisi\\nThough it isn’t a bold shade of pink, the pink crystals of sand in the shoreline are easy to see. I’ve never seen a pink beach before, so I thought Elafonisi was amazing. It’s easy to see why Crete is one of the best Greek islands for fabulous beaches.\\nRead More:\\nThe 7 Best Greek Islands for Beaches (You’ve Never Heard of #4)\\nPosted signs warn visitors not to damage the natural environment by taking any of the pink sand (this is apparently a problem).\\nTip:\\nIf you want to visit this beautiful beach but you’re not up for the white-knuckle drive (I hear you!), there are excellent day tour options to Elafonisi from Chania. This one is my top pick:\\n#1 Pick\\nElafonisi, Falasarna & Vouves Shared Tour from Chania\\nThis full-day small group tour includes plenty of free time at Elafonisi and two more of Crete’s top beaches, plus lunch, snacks, a terrific guide, and zero stress.\\nCheck Dates & Rates\\nWe explore the various coves of Elafonisi and spend some quality time lounging on the pink sands. But by mid-afternoon, it’s time to hit the road if we’re going to squeeze in a trip to Reythmno.\\nA quick stop in Reythmno\\nThree hours later, we arrive in the harbor of\\nReythmno\\n. It is lovely, but it’s no match for Chania. We definitely made the right choice between Chania and Reythmno.\\nWe get some ice cream and stroll the port’s shop-lined, cobbled lanes. An hour later, we’re back in the car bound for Chania.\\nStick with Chania or Move On?\\nThat night, over dinner in the harbor, we make the easy decision to spend our final two nights in Chania as well.\\nHowever, it’s time to upgrade our hotel situation and splurge on a room with a view. We’ve been secretly coveting several hotels around the harbor with terraces and (what must be) incredible views.\\nA Room with a View in Chania\\nAs we eat, we search rates for our top picks. We identify a few favorites and then narrow it down to three:\\n1. The\\nPlaza Apartment\\n, which has a spacious terrace and sweeping views of the harbor. Sadly, a quick check reveals it is fully booked for the week.\\n2.\\nCaptain Vasilis Hotel\\n– Also boasting a striking terrace and pristine location in the harbor.\\n3.\\nErietta Suites Hotel\\n– Great views of the harbor, reasonable rates…but also fully booked for the next two nights.\\nSo we go straight to the source and walk right into the lobby at Captain Vasilis to ask if we can see a room. The helpful manager shows us around the small B&B and up to the terrace we’ve spotted from the harbor.\\nThe view is simply incredible. SOLD!\\nThe terrace we spotted at the Captain Vassilis hotel\\nThe rate is nearly twice what we were paying at Nikolas Rooms, but it is a considerable upgrade for a very reasonable price.\\nWe book it on the spot for our last two nights.\\nDay 3. Gramvousa and Balos Islands\\nFor our third day on Crete, we have another full day planned. First up, we catch the 8:00am bus to the port of Kissamos.\\nFrom there, we’ll hook up with our boat for the day.\\nWe arrive at the port around 9:30am and are mildly alarmed at the size of the ship. There are easily 400 people aboard the large ferry boat.\\nWe immediately fear this might be one of those obnoxious group tours, elbow to elbow on the beach with everyone else.\\nBut we shouldn’t have worried.\\nDespite the large number of people aboard, both islands are huge. There is plenty of room for us to carve out our own little bit of serenity at each stop, away from the crowds.\\nAfter a one-hour sail from Kissamos, we arrive at our first stop, the more ambitious of the two, Gramvousa Island.\\nFirst stop, Gramvousa\\nGramvousa features a perfect stretch of white sand beach, complete with an awesome shipwreck peeking up from the emerald sea just offshore.\\nViews from the castle on Gramvousa Island\\nHowever, the island’s top sight is easily the Venetian castle towering atop a steep rock, 500ft above sea level. It’s considered one of the most impressive castles in Crete, so like most of our fellow passengers, we make the climb to the top instead of lounging around on the beach.\\nThe climb is tough in the mid-day heat, but we are rewarded with incredible views of the sea from every corner of the castle.\\nRead More:\\nCrete’s Stunning Gramvousa Island is Home to an Ancient Fortress and a Ghostly Shipwreck\\nThe island itself explodes with colorful flora and fauna and has tremendous views of our next stop, Balos Island. By the time we climb back down, the ship is blasting its departure horn.\\nSo much for beach time!\\nThe Spectacular Balos Lagoon\\nOur next stop at the Balos Lagoon is all about relaxation.\\nBalos Lagoon\\nLike Elafonisi yesterday, the beach is actually a vast lagoon with several different beach areas. Deciding to forgo the more crowded umbrella and beach chair area, we find a quiet area off to the side of the main beach and spread out our towels to relax for a while.\\nThe ferry docked in the distance\\nIt is a splendid way to spend an afternoon.\\nTip:\\nIf you don’t want to do a bus to Kissamos and the ferry ride, this is my pick for a more relaxed day at the beach:\\n#1 Pick\\nBalos & Falassarna Beach – Jeep Tour w/Loungers & Lunch\\nThis full-day small-group Jeep Tour is one of the top-rated tours on the island. And it’s the perfect way to dodge the ferry and avoid the crowds. You’ll stop at Balos for photos & then head to Falassarna Beach (a local favorite). It also includes lunch and reserved lounge chairs, something Balos doesn’t have.\\nCheck Dates & Rates\\nWe enjoy nearly three hours of relaxation time on Balos before it’s time to head back to Kissamos for the drive back to Chania.\\nRead More:\\nThe Dreamy Aquamarine Hues of\\xa0Balos Lagoon Make it the Best Day Trip in Crete\\nDay 4. A Vacation from our Crete Vacation\\nFor our fourth\\xa0day on Crete, there are lots of things we could do.\\nThe other major day trip on this end of the island is hiking the Samaria Gorge, a rugged 6-hour hike that’s supposed to be fabulous. We could also take the local bus to any number of beaches along the coast.\\nWhat we actually do is take a vacation from our (so far) exhausting vacation. And not just our Crete vacation. We’ve been sightseeing at full-throttle for two weeks straight. We are spent.\\nA day to relax, sleep in, and not plan anything is definitely in order. So after a serene morning, we head over to our new hotel at the very civilized hour of 11:00am.\\nAn Upgrade to Captain Vasilis\\nThe room at\\nCaptain Vasilis\\nis just as fantastic as we hoped. Twice the size of the one we’ve been sharing for the past three nights. It even has a Jacuzzi tub with a million-dollar view of the harbor.\\nWe’ve been wishing for a giant tub in which to soak our tired legs for a week and finally, we have one! Trade-off times for the tub are immediately established as we settle into our fancy new digs.\\nLater, we grab lunch and finally take a stroll around the harbor’s Venetian walls and out to the lighthouse. Chania’s architecture has a strong Venetian-Turkish influence which really adds to its charm.\\nThe view from our new terrace and my office for the day\\nThe town was also heavily bombed during WWII and some of its unique atmosphere is due to a variety of nearly demolished buildings being reinvented as shops and restaurants.\\nThat afternoon we try out one of the many glass-bottom boat trips available from Chania harbor.\\nWe opt for the 2-hour trip with\\nCaptain Nick’s Boat Tours\\nwhich circles Thodorou and Lazaretta islands and over the top of wreckage from an airplane shot down in World War II.\\nIt’s another gorgeous day and the boat tour is the perfect way to get out on the water and get a look at some of the other beaches near Chania.\\nLast Night in Chania\\nWe make the most of our terrace tonight with a sunset glass of wine. Then choose a new spot for dinner and try to come up with a plan for\\nHeraklion\\n.\\nWine on the terrace enjoying our view!\\nI have a flight out tomorrow night to Rhodes. But Shannon has two more nights on Crete and still needs to secure a room on that side of the island.\\nDay 5. The Port City of Heraklion\\nFor my last day on Crete, we hop on the 9:00am bus from Chania to Heraklion and arrive in town just after 11:00am. My flight doesn’t depart until 8:00pm tonight, so we have plenty of time left to explore Heraklion and visit the nearby Minoan Palace of Knossos.\\nShannon’s hotel is the gorgeous\\nAquila Atlantis Hotel\\nnear the port and we find it easily after a short walk from the bus stop.\\nHeraklion is exactly as our local friends in Chania described it, a big city. Though the harbor area is pretty and the hotel is fabulous, the town itself is definitely lacking the charm and character of Chania.\\nWe are instantly certain we made the right decision about where to spend our time while on Crete.\\nWe ditch our luggage in Shannon’s room and wander the old Venetian port area for a bit before catching the bus over to Knossos.\\nAncient History at Knossos\\nFor many visitors to Crete, Knossos is the main attraction.\\nExcavation of the site containing two major Minoan palaces begun under Arthur Evans in 1900. Prior to that time, little was known about the ancient Minoan people.\\nGetting a few shots at Knossos\\nExcavations continue to this day but during Evans’ time, he did something many considered controversial. He rebuilt large parts of the palace based on evidence that he had uncovered.\\nBest Knossos Guided Tour:\\nFull-Day Trip to Knossos Cave of Zeus and Olive Oil Factory\\nThroughout the site, reconstructed walls, stairs, windows, and columns give visitors a sense of what the palace may have looked like so many centuries ago.\\nWhile his actions at Knossos may have been controversial to some, it sure helps those of us without an archaeology degree gain a better appreciation for the place.\\nPalace of Knossos, Crete\\nLike many of the incredible ruins I’ve seen across Greece in\\nAthens\\nand the island of\\nCyprus\\n, it’s a fascinating site to visit and explore.\\nAfter wandering Knossos for a while, we grab the bus back into the city. There is just enough time for one last Cretan meal before I leave for the airport.\\nHeraklion vs Chania: Did We Make the Right Decision?\\nOur lack of initial planning turned out to be a solid strategy. When we fell in love with Chania we were able to pivot and spend our whole stay there.\\nI’m a natural planner (it’s what I do for a living), so it was a struggle for me to leave Crete to work itself out upon arrival. But the fact that it worked out so perfectly has inspired me to consider a more relaxed approach to travel planning going forward.\\nMaybe.\\nSo, yes, we made the right decision by choosing Chania over Heraklion. It’s Crete’s most beautiful town and some of the island’s best beaches are an easy day trip away.\\nChania Town\\nNext up, a late-night flight to\\nRhodes\\nbefore continuing on to the Greek island I’m most excited about on this trip, Symi!\\nRead More:\\nSparkling Symi is the Best Greek Island You’ve Never Heard Of\\nPin it for later!\\nLooking for more fantastic Greek Islands to explore?

We’re spending 4 days in Crete for our honeymoon (Gahh not nearly enough time, but we only have 14 days total, and we’re doing Athens, Mykonos, Santorini, and Crete!).  We’re getting into Heraklion, spending a night, then driving (renting a car) to Chania for 2 nights, and heading back for our last day/night in Heraklion before catching a flight out first thing in the morning.  Would LOVE any restaurant recommendations or particular spots you enjoyed strolling around in Chania.  LOVED the blog!\\nJenny\\nsays:\\nat\\nHi Robin! That sounds like an amazing honeymoon!! You picked the best 3 Greek islands of the whole bunch. My husband and I spent some time on Santorini on our honeymoon last summer and it was absolute bliss. Definitely rent a quad bike to get out and explore, we had so much fun riding around the island with our own wheels. On Mykonos, my favorite beach is Platis Gialos. It’s away from the party scene, quiet and just stunningly beautiful. The sunsets from Little Venice each night are just to die for. It’s super easy to use the local bus system to get between town and all the beaches. As for Crete, well 4 days isn’t enough to see it all (5 wasn’t either!) but you can definitely cover a lot of ground. I wish I could remember a single name of a restaurant but in Chania we really just walked along the waterfront and picked a new place to try every night. They were all good, we never had a bad meal anywhere on that island. The harbor in Chania is just stunning, that was my favorite spot on the whole island and we spent lots of time just walking around it. Congratulations on your wedding! I hope you guys have a wonderful time exploring Greece on your honeymoon, you couldn’t have picked a more romantic spot 🙂\\nDivya\\nsays:\\nat\\nGreat post! 🙂 I booked two nights at Captain Vilasis upon your recommendation, thanks.\\nJenny\\nsays:\\nat\\nAwesome!

It should be enough for two weeks island hopping and a short visit to Crete to cross the Samaria Gorge.

And perhaps the best of them all is Elafonisi Beach.\\nBest suited for those staying in the romantic town of\\nChania\\n, Elafonisi\\xa0is the very definition of beach perfection with\\npure white sandbars and crystal clear, turquoise waters\\n. Many have described Elafonisi beach as a literal heaven on earth with multi-tonal colours playing out across both the sand and sea. Although most will require a car to reach this little slice of paradise, what awaits you at the end of your journey is truly worth the drive.\\nFor peace and tranquilty, Elafonsi is an unbeatable choice and also perfect for families with young children due to the calm waters and options to rent umbrellas on the beach.\\nOUR TOP TIP\\n: Best visited out of high season to avoid the crowds and tour buses - but absolutely worth a trip at any time of the year.\\nOur beautiful, modern Villa Icarus is situated nearby, to view details\\nclick here\\n!\\nKiani Akti Beach\\nJust 1.5km from\\nKalives\\nlies this\\xa0pleasantly uncrowded beach which boasts a long and relatively secluded sandy beach. Also known as Kyani Akti, this charming stretch of white sand is within easy driving distance of both Kalives and Chania - far enough from the main crowds but also blessed with helpful amenities. The crystal clear waters are\\nideal for snorkelling and also very safe for small children\\n, making it ideal for families. A great choice for those who\\xa0require a quieter beach that is still within\\xa0easy distance of amenities and the\\ntown of Kalives\\n.\\nOUR TOP TIP\\n: If travelling with children be sure to pack some little floating toys as the river Kiliaris\\xa0is situated in the middle of the beach - feeding water into the sea from the White Mountains. Undoubtedly one of the best beaches in the area for young adventurers to play!\\nJust a short drive away lies our gorgeous comtemporary 3 bed/3 bath luxury stone Villa Louisa. To view this Villa,\\nclick here\\n!\\nFalassarna\\nLess than 40 miles west of\\nChania\\nlies one\\xa0of the most famous and beautiful beaches in Greece. Fallasarna has been awarded the accolade of both \"\\nBest beach in Crete\\n\" as well as one of the top ten beaches in Europe in recent years. Jutifiable praise\\xa0considering the incredible beauty of this stunning\\xa0white sandy beach. The main beach at Fallasarna is Pacheia Anmos which\\xa0stretches to a length of 1km. With snack bars and cafes, visitors can choose to eat here rather than pack a picnic -\\xa0particularly handy for those travelling with young children.\\nNorth of the main beach lies another long stretch of tropical sand which is divided in half by a sand dune. For those wishing to appreciate a quieter atmosphere this beach has no facilities and as such, affords more privacy and solitude. The chapel of Agia Paraskevi\\xa0can be found nearby together with a charming little fresh water spring. Perfect for those wishing to explore beyond the sand!\\nThe area surrounding Falassarna is a Natura protected region and incredibly romantic at sunset. For a beach that is perhaps more suited to be situated in the Carribean than Europe, travellers who brave the 37 mile drive from Chania will certainly not be disappointed.\\nOUR TOP TIP\\n: This area can get rather windy so a great choice for those wishing to windsurf!\\nVisiting Crete?

We are not planning on renting a car, as the thought of driving in Greece frankly scares me. H\\nHowever, how realistic is it to travel this island without a car and relying on public transportation? Also, are there some good companies that could be recommended for drivers, as may consider doing so if we are wanting to go to more remote places?\\nPosted by\\nLee\\nCamarillo, California\\n10/19/23 08:24 PM\\n3149 posts\\nIt\\'s not difficult, just time-consuming to use the bus system.  It takes a minimum of a week with a rental car just to barely scratch the surface of what Crete has to offer.  I can\\'t imagine what it would be like by bus.  Crete\\'s roads are fine.  There\\'s nothing to worry about.  If you live in a country where drivers use the left side of the road it might be a bit of a challenge at first, but after a while you\\'ll be fine.  If you do decide to rent a car I strongly recommend you reserve one with an automatic transmission so there\\'s one less challenge you\\'d have to deal with using a manual transmission.\\nPosted by\\nJoLui\\nFrance Southwest\\n10/19/23 08:46 PM\\n2723 posts\\nWhy does the thought of driving in Crete scare you?\\nIf you are used to driving regularly, is there something specific and unique about the roads in Crete that would prevent you from driving, or have you already had a bad experience driving in Crete?\\nIn this case you can use public buses.\\nIn Greece public buses are managed by the Ktel companies.\\nThe main website for Crete is this:\\nhttps://www.e-ktel.com/en/\\nThe specific website for Heraklion is\\nhttps://www.ktelherlas.gr/en/\\nThe bus network is good but be aware that you will be completely dependent on bus schedules and routes, so you will probably have to remove some \"remote places\" from your plans.\\nThat being said, Crete sees around 3 million tourists every year. If there was any particular danger in driving, it would be known.\\nPosted by\\nSuki\\n10/20/23 12:40 AM\\n11911 posts\\nWhat frightens you about driving on Crete?? Are you renting cars in other areas of Greece?  We spent two weeks there in Chania and covered a good portion of western Crete including the southern coast.\\nTouring by bus on Crete  would not be easy or productive. Rent a car and enjoy Crete.\\nPosted by\\nLark Ascending\\nPortland OR\\n10/21/23 03:57 AM\\n11 posts\\nOur group of 4 rented a car for two consecutive days of our 12 days on Crete earlier this month.  The highways and roads are well maintained, and the Greeks seemed to be very good drivers.  There is a driving custom on Crete (apparently not on the mainland) that, if safe to do so, drivers stay to the right - including driving on the paved shoulder - to allow others to pass.  That was easy to adapt to.  Where you don\\'t want to do much driving is in places like the old town sections of Heraklion and Chania, with narrow, sometimes winding little streets that are often one way.  And we drove through a few small towns in the mountains where slowing down and allowing oncoming cars to pass just made sense.   But in just the two days we had the car (with an automatic transmission) we visited far more places than we could have done relying on the bus system, and we felt safe the whole time.\\nPosted by\\nEmily\\nVienna, Austria\\n10/21/23 06:36 AM\\n5613 posts\\nYou will see half as much and spend twice the time getting anywhere. You won’t be able to reach any famous beach or hiking spot.\\nJust rent a frikin car. We drove all over the place. The roads are good. It isn’t scary.\\nPosted by\\ntommyk5\\nNH (USA)\\n10/21/23 02:25 PM\\n1273 posts\\nAny time you do something new regardless of what it is there is some anxiety involved.\\nDriving in another country is definitely anxiety causing.\\nJust because you drive with no problems where you live doesn\\'t mean it will be the same in Greece or another country.\\nHowever I\\'ve driven on many islands and the Peloponnese and for the most part there were no problems. The biggest challenge is using a paper map which may be hard to follow especially on secondary and back roads.\\nI use Google Maps for navigation and for the most part works well with some \"hiccups\" here and there. Eventually I got to where I wanted to.\\nCrete is the largest of the Greek Islands and you could spend weeks and still not cover everything.\\nWith 10 days I would select one part of the island rather than driving to all parts of it. There\\'s more than enough to experience in each area to keep you occupied.\\nWhile there is decent bus service it doesn\\'t go everywhere and the schedule can be difficult for planning.\\nRent a car, you\\'ll see far more and experience more out of the way areas of Crete and driving will not be any more difficult than back home other than not always knowing the route you are taking to get somewhere.\\nPosted by\\nBethFL\\n10/21/23 03:31 PM\\n3017 posts\\nWe rented a car for half the time we were in Crete.  You can do a lot without a car. We flew into Chania, stayed three nights, and then took a bus to  Hora Sfakion on the southwest coast. We traveled by ferry (there are no roads here)nand then took a bus back from Sougia to Chania where we rented a car.  But we could have easily taken another bus and gone to Rethymnon and Heraklion. You can take a bus to Knossos.\\nThe buses are modern and pleasant. You can go a lot of places easily but of course a car gives you more flexibility.\\nPosted by\\nJC\\nPortsmouth\\n10/22/23 04:21 PM\\n5634 posts\\nMy family and I spent two weeks in Crete this summer and due to medication I was taking I was unable to do the driving (I always do the driving usually) so my wife undertook the task. She hates driving in a foreign country, even more so if they drive on the right yet even she quickly became comfortable with driving there.\\nI couldn\\'t imagine trying to explore the island by public transport, it would be far too time consuming and restrictive.\\nPosted by\\nMike L\\nDetroit, MI\\n10/23/23 01:54 AM\\n1084 posts\\nIn October 2018, on Crete I took the bus from Heraklion to Chania. The bus ride worked out ok. I bought the ticket at the bus station about one-and-a-half hours in advance. The station might have been semi-fancy with a cafe, but just before getting on the bus I was waiting under a covered semi-outdoor area with other passengers. Since my trip to Greece, I have rented a car twice, in Southern California, and in Florida. I have not rented a car in Greece or in any other country (yet). Those were my only two times renting a car. KTEL is the long distance bus company in Greece. The company is divided up into subdivisions that are each operated semi-independently in different regions. Thats why there might be more than one KTEL website. You don\\'t need to rent a car on Crete. I was traveling solo. Don\\'t waste your money on renting a car that you don\\'t want to drive anyway. Don\\'t rent a car just to avoid feeling stupid for going against the advice from other repliers (who do not have experience taking the bus). I assure you that you will be fine with the buses. Here is what might be accurate schedules. Or the schedules might change before your trip. Check again just before your trip.\\nhttps://e-ktel.com/en/\\nAlso I took a local bus in Heraklion to and from Knossos, and from near my hostel in Chania to the place my overnight ferry departed.\\nIn Heraklion just after I got off my ferry when I arrived, I saw waiting taxis. I got a ride in a taxi to my hotel.\\nJump to top\\nThis topic has been automatically closed due to a period of inactivity.\\nAbout Us\\nContact Information\\nWhat We Do\\nMeet the Staff\\nSocial Responsibility\\nClimate Smart\\nJobs\\nTravel Help\\nFAQ\\nTours FAQ\\nAsk Us\\nTravel Classes\\nVisit the Travel Center\\nGuidebook Updates\\nSubmit Book Feedback\\nPublications\\nTravel News Email\\nTour News Email\\nSubscription Center\\nMedia Partners\\nTV Programmers\\nRadio Programmers\\nSyndicated Content\\nPress Room\\nContact Us\\nemail\\nphone\\nmap\\nFollow Us\\nFacebook\\nInstagram\\nYouTube\\nTikTok\\nPinterest\\nTwitter\\n©2025 Rick Steves\\' Europe, Inc. | CST# 2086743 |\\nTerms of Service\\n|\\nPrivacy Policy',\n",

Its name comes from the natural freshwater springs that emerge from the pebbled shoreline, offering visitors a refreshing and unique experience. [...] Unlike well-known tourist beaches, Crete’s secluded shores offer a more intimate and serene environment.

These hidden spots provide a unique opportunity to relax, meditate, or engage in activities like photography, snorkeling and even hiking. [...] Kedrodasos Beach is one of Crete’s most breathtaking secluded spots.

       "AIMessage(content='Here is a 500-word history of the development of hip-hop:\\n\\nHip-hop, one of the most influential and popular music genres of the 20th century, has a rich and fascinating history that spans over four decades. Born in the early 1970s in the Bronx, New York City, hip-hop culture was initially a form of self-expression and social commentary for African American and Latino youth.\\n\\n**The Early Years (1970s)**\\n\\nHip-hop\\'s origins can be traced back to the block parties of DJ Kool Herc, a Jamaican-American DJ who is often credited with inventing hip-hop music. In 1973, Herc began experimenting with turntables and extending breaks (instrumental sections) to create a continuous flow of music that allowed people to dance longer. This innovation laid the foundation for hip-hop\\'s distinctive sound.\\n\\nAs hip-hop evolved, other pioneers emerged. Afrika Bambaataa, a Bronx-based DJ and MC (rapper), organized the Zulu Nation, a group of DJs, MCs, and breakdancers who shared a passion for hip-hop culture. The Zulu Nation\\'s parties and events helped spread hip-hop throughout the Bronx, and the culture began to take shape.\\n\\n**The Golden Age (1980s)**\\n\\nThe 1980s are often referred to as hip-hop\\'s \"Golden Age.\" During this period, hip-hop expanded beyond the Bronx and gained popularity across the United States. Groups like Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, the Cold Crush Brothers, and the Treacherous Three helped define hip-hop\\'s early sound.\\n\\nThe introduction of the hip-hop single \"The Message\" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five in 1982 marked a significant turning point in hip-hop history. The song\\'s socially conscious lyrics, written by Melle Mel and Duke Bootee, addressed issues like poverty, crime, and social inequality, showcasing hip-hop\\'s potential as a powerful medium for storytelling and social commentary.\\n\\n**West Coast Rise ( Late 1980s-Early 1990s)**\\n\\nAs hip-hop spread across the country, the West Coast scene began to flourish. Artists like Ice-T, N.W.A, and Dr. Dre created a new sound that blended hip-hop with funk, rock, and gangsta rap. The West Coast\\'s hip-hop scene was characterized by its laid-back beats, gangsta lyrics, and a sense of rebellion against mainstream culture.\\n\\nThe release of N.W.A\\'s \"Straight Outta Compton\" in 1988 sparked controversy and attention, cementing gangsta rap\\'s place in hip-hop. Dr. Dre\\'s \"The Chronic\" (1992) and Snoop Dogg\\'s \"Doggystyle\" (1993) further solidified the West Coast\\'s dominance in hip-hop.\\n\\n**East Coast Revival (Mid 1990s)**\\n\\nIn the mid-1990s, the East Coast hip-hop scene experienced a resurgence. The Notorious B.I.G.\\'s \"Ready to Die\" (1994) and Tupac Shakur\\'s \"Me Against the World\" (1995) showcased the East Coast\\'s lyrical dexterity and storytelling ability. The rivalry between East Coast and West Coast hip-hop, fueled by the media and record labels, led to a creative explosion, with both coasts producing some of the most innovative and critically acclaimed hip-hop of the 1990s.\\n\\n**Globalization and Diversification ( Late 1990s-Present)**\\n\\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, hip-hop continued to diversify and globalize. Artists like Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Lil Wayne achieved mainstream success, while sub-genres like crunk, snap, and conscious rap emerged. Hip-hop also spread to other countries, with artists like UK\\'s Dizzee Rascal and France\\'s La Fouine achieving international recognition.\\n\\nToday, hip-hop is a global phenomenon, with a vast and diverse range of styles, themes, and artists. From its humble beginnings in the Bronx to its current status as a dominant force in popular music, hip-hop\\'s history is a testament to the power of creativity, innovation, and self-expression.\\n\\nWord Count: 500', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 853, 'prompt_tokens': 23, 'total_tokens': 876, 'completion_time': 2.071011988, 'prompt_time': 0.004447955, 'queue_time': 0.15949159799999998, 'total_time': 2.075459943}, 'model_name': 'meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_699032b16f', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-0d991a73-edea-4bb7-a6b5-ebb1fae66146-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 23, 'output_tokens': 853, 'total_tokens': 876})"
