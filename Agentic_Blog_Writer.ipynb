We’ve written about it before. Our competitors have too.\\nSo this time, we want to show you something different.\\nOur\\nTikTok UGC agency\\nwants to let you in on our home process for user-generated content creation.\\nWe’ll take you through our usual frame, strategies, and opportunities.\\nAlso, we’ll discuss insider secrets, our personal experiences, and the lessons we learned.\\nAs always, you can find plenty of examples in this article, so keep reading below.\\nTL;DR\\nTikTok UGC is a valuable strategy targeting young audiences, with persuasive power for products/services.\\nSuccessful TikTok UGC campaigns adapt strategies, set measurable goals, and leverage influencers.\\nKey metrics include CPI, ad spend, CPM, and average watch time.\\nEffective content relies on engaging hooks and testing different approaches.\\nInfluencers bring variety, resonating with broad audiences.\\nA/B and hook testing optimize content, leading to scaling in a three-month timeline.\\nSmall businesses can start with authentic videos, while expert assistance and cross-channel promotion enhance results.\\nWhat Is TikTok UGC?\\nUser-generated content (UGC) on TikTok refers to original content created by real users, showcasing their creativity and authenticity.\\nIt encompasses various content types, including viral videos, dance moves, how-to videos, and product reviews.\\nTikTok UGC fosters genuine connections and a sense of community, making TikTok a perfect platform for brands to engage with potential audiences through authentic content.\\nThis type of content can influence purchasing decisions and enhance community engagement.\\nBut let\\'s see some real numbers to prove those claims:\\nWhy Use TikTok UGC?\\nTikTok UGC is a fruitful strategy for companies of all sizes. Research shows that:\\n44.1% of TikTok users\\nare 20 to 39 years old, and\\n37% of them\\nare in the top third of spenders.\\nTikTok is replacing Google as a search engine, with\\n40% of young people\\nturning to TikTok when they search for specific products or services\\nTikTok users are\\ntwice as likely\\nto recommend products/services discovered on TikTok compared to other social channel users. They’re also 1.5x more likely to successfully persuade their friends to try that product/service.\\nUGC is more persuasive than branded content because\\n90% of people\\ntrust UGC, but\\nonly 4%\\ntrust branded messages.\\nNumerous companies are already on TikTok, creating successful campaigns. inBeat’s results with this channel have also been extraordinary.\\n1) We helped Hopper scale UGC ads on TikTok to\\navoid ad fatigue\\nand drive down CPAs.\\nOur results include ongoing genuine high-performing creatives:\\n2) We also cut down CPAs by 75% and increased downloads to over 100, 000 per month for Unroll.me:\\nAnd these are just two of the companies we’ve worked with. Annually, more and more companies set larger portions of their marketing budgets towards TikTok UGC.\\nThat means they have also seen some good results on the platform, or at least convincing evidence that they could reach their goals.\\nSuch advantages include:\\nIncreased organic reach\\nTighter engagement\\nMore sales\\nMost chances to reach Gen Z\\nCheaper ads compared to Meta\\nGet the most out of your TikTok campaigns with our\\nfull-service UGC agency\\n!\\nOur Creative Growth Agency\\'s TikTok UGC Plan\\nThe TikTok train is on the move, so you can hop onboard or be left behind.\\nHere’s the problem:\\nTikTok is not like most channels, and its audience is not like most audiences:\\nTikTok users are extremely creative:\\nTheir videos follow a whole narrative arc from exposition to resolution.\\nTikTok users are part of a generation who isn’t afraid of being controlled by Internet algorithms\\n: That’s because they’ve learned to manipulate those algorithms in their favor, to receive tailored content.\\nTikTok’s algorithm is very volatile:\\nYou cannot really bend it to your usual marketing weapons, like precise targeting. And very similar types of content can provide extremely different results.\\nHere’s the solution:\\nLearn to adapt your strategy to fit this channel and this audience. If you can produce high-quality content, TikTok users will help your brand gain more recognition and conversions than you’ve ever dreamed possible.\\nWe’ll share our secrets below:\\n1. Initial Research\\nThe first stage of any good campaign must be the research, and that’s what we’re doing too. We start by listening to the customer first, analyzing their current problems and the context.\\nThat’s so we can move on to setting goals.\\nWe focus on the company’s:\\nAudience:\\nWho they are, what they need.\\nCompetitors:\\nProducts, communication, customer support, top-performing ads.\\nCompany:\\nHistory, products and services, their top-performing content.\\nWe then integrate this knowledge in a\\nSWOT analysis\\nfocusing on the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\\nPro tip:\\nDo an analysis for your agency too, not just the brand you’re working with.\\nIn this first stage of our campaigns, we’re also looking at:\\nPast campaigns we did for the specific company\\nOur experience\\nWays to measure everything\\nThis last step is specifically important. For example, in the case of a mobile app like Hopper, we considered:\\nThe MMP (mobile measurement partner):\\nTo ensure their third-party data provider could collect and organize all app-related data so we could have the whole picture\\nThe tracking system:\\nThis is an important factor for tracking the cost per download, cost per activation, and so forth\\n2. Goals\\nEach TikTok UGC campaign will have a different goal. Some want to increase awareness, others focus on engagement, and others on sales.\\nSide note:\\nTikTok has been traditionally used to bring more traffic to online stores. However, the platform has recently shown to be an excellent tool for getting more customers to\\noffline stores\\n.\\nSo you can always set that goal too.\\nInsider story:\\nSome companies who come to inBeat aren’t able to create enough high-quality content that performs well. Most have been working with agencies or platforms that cannot provide enough relevant content regularly.\\nFor example, we built a TikTok UGC campaign to drive installs for the Mogo.ca budgeting app. We chose TikTok for this purpose because\\nresearch shows\\n:\\nFinance-related TikTok video views grew 2.7 times.\\n54% of people are more likely to turn to TikTok for finance-related content than other platforms.\\n50% have bought a financial product they saw on TikTok.\\n3. KPIs\\ninBeat chooses KPIs according to the client’s marketing goals.\\nPossible KPIs for TikTok UGC include:\\nCost per install (CPI):\\nThis is the main KPI for a mobile app in the context of a conversion-focus campaign. A paid user within the app counts as a conversion on the website. A successful campaign has a low cost per install.\\nAd spend:\\nA lower ad spend is technically better, but\\nTikTok posts\\nare more expensive than Instagram or Facebook posts. TikTok UGC can help you lower that ad spend, though.\\nCost per mille (CPM):\\nThe average CPM for TikTok ads is $10/1000 views. However, your budget also depends on the type of ad you choose (e.g., in-feed ads, branded takeover, top-view ads). This could get you to $50, 000/day or more.\\nAverage watch time:\\nThe longer people watch your ad, the more successful you are at keeping their attention.\\n4. Strategy\\ninBeat builds the strategy for each campaign based on personalized data. We don’t focus as much on instinct, trends, or opinions.\\nInstead, we measure everything as we explained in the above stages. After that, we choose the right tactic and instruments.\\nIn this case, let’s say we have already decided the tactic is using TikTok UGC. Our go-to instrument here is creator UGC.\\nSide note:\\nOrganizing UGC campaigns using content from real customers is a lengthy process that can use up many resources.\\nYou have to collect that content, pick the best pieces, edit those, and then repurpose them in other channels. We’re not saying it’s not doable – but it’s definitely not the smoothest road to take.\\nThat’s where we have the advantage:\\ninBeat has a massive database of content creators, chosen from the top-performing 2% of influencers.\\n\\u200d\\nWe have worked with many of them, so we know what they can do in terms of content, deadlines, and team collaboration.\\nJust to get an idea, the average TikTok engagement rate is 6.72%, but our creators can reach 20% or more. That means they already have a captive audience that’s more likely to follow these influencers’ advice.\\nAnd remember that UGC is already a very persuasive type of content.\\nOur influencers can produce TikTok UGC like unboxing, tutorials, and more. Then, inBeat curates the content and produces UGC ads.\\nPro tip:\\nIf you want seamless UGC, our\\nUGC marketplace\\ncan help you get high-quality content from the best creators too.\\n5. Content\\nAfter selecting the tactic and instruments, we decide on the content. You can use different types of\\nTikTok UGC ads\\ndepending on your goals:\\nIn-feed ads:\\nCheapest and easiest to adapt to demographic factors\\nBrand takeover ads:\\nThe most actionable; best for landing pages\\nChallenge ads:\\nBest for organic traffic\\nShoppable ads:\\nBest for increased conversions\\nInsider tip:\\nThe biggest challenge of creating effective content is to truly understand your audience. What works can vary widely depending on the type of person you’re trying to address.\\nSometimes we do very raw and native-looking UGC:\\nIn this case, the objective is for the content to resemble a regular TikTok clip, not an ad. These videos are best for the middle and bottom of the funnel, where we need to drive more conversions without being too pushy.\\nOther times we create professional-looking UGC:\\nThese TikTok ads mimic the YouTube style more. Although the homemade feeling is still there, these creators have proper lighting and do highly edited videos. These clips are best for creating awareness and explaining more advanced features, so we typically use them for the top of the funnel.\\nPro tip:\\nRegardless of the type of content you choose, focus on the hook. Hooks are so important that they deserve their own section:\\n6. Hooks\\nWhen we run UGC, we do multiple hooks per video.\\nThe first hook is the most important, and we’ll place that during the first five seconds of the video. Those seconds are decisive for keeping your audience interested.\\nRemember:\\nAttention spans are very low, and TikTok users can scroll away after just one second.\\nIf people lose interest and don’t watch your TikTok, they won’t click the link we usually embed. Therefore, they won’t purchase or download the app we’re promoting.\\nPro tip:\\nWe found that the percentage of people who watch the entire hook is closely related to other metrics, such as cost per sale (or cost per install in an app install campaign).\\nHere’s an excellent example of a hook one of our influencers created for Hopper. The 3-second liner is:\\n“Here’s a secret travel hack that I use to book cheaper flights every single time.”\\nAnd here’s how we see their files:\\n7. Influencers\\nAt inBeat, we start with the strategy first and then discover influencers that can match it.\\nOf course, the brands we’re working for can approve or decline the content creators we suggest.\\n\\u200d\\nSide note:\\nYou, too, can access our influencer database for free. It’s\\nright here\\n.\\nAlternatively, read more about how to pick the right content creators in\\nthis article\\n.\\nAfter our clients have given us their go-ahead:\\nWe share the creative brief with our content creators.\\nWe meet with them to ensure we’re on the same page. We want to clarify the campaign goal, underline KPIs, and explain our expectations in terms of content.\\nInsider tip:\\nTikTok UGC works like a charm for wide-appeal brands.\\nThat means your creators must have different personalities and message styles.\\nLet’s explain: TikTok’s targeting algorithm lacks the options marketers are used to from other platforms, like Meta.\\nBut when you target broad, without restrictions for your audience, the TikTok ads algorithm is pretty good at finding who resonates best with a particular ad.\\n\\u200d\\nStorytime:\\nWe experienced this first-hand with one of our clients –\\nUnroll.me\\n.\\nThis inbox-decluttering app has a broad audience.\\nAlmost everyone can relate to having an inbox swamped with subscriptions and newsletters.\\nOur top-performing creators had very different messages, although they are in the same age group and would otherwise have overlapping audiences.\\n\\u200d\\nTikTok’s algorithm decided who to target for each ad:\\nThe slower-paced ads: TikTok automatically targeted them for the 55+ age group.\\nRemember, we didn’t zero in on an audience when we started this campaign.\\nThe faster-paced ads: TikTok targeted them for the 18-24 age group.\\nThe ads were filmed with a high-quality camera, featured fast-paced animated text instead of captions, and had grade-A lighting.\\nLesson learned:\\nThere are fewer TikTok users in the 55+ age group compared to the younger generations.\\nBesides, influencers have less sway in this segment.\\nThat’s why most companies choose not to follow this segment at all on TikTok.\\nHonestly, we didn’t focus on 55+ people, either.\\nBut TikTok’s algorithm showed us that some ads can genuinely become top-performing in this segment.\\nYou just have to create the right content for this audience using the right influencers.\\n8. Running the Ads and A/B Testing\\nAfter creating this content, we build a content library for our clients. Afterward, we run the paid ads.\\nLike we said before, inBeat relies more on hard cold data than instinct. That’s why we test every post or ad we create.\\nInsider tip:\\nSomething that we’re doing at inBeat – and not most other companies do – is hook testing.\\nHere’s how that works:\\nWe typically ask creators to provide one video UGC ad each, but with three different hooks.\\nThat means we have three different options for the first few seconds.\\nWe’re testing all three versions in our campaigns because one usually performs much better than the others.\\nThat’s the winner hook we’ll use in the future.\\nWhy?\\nTikTok is a very unpredictable channel. Even if the ads or posts are very similar, it’s hard to say which will do better.\\nRemember:\\nTikTok is a volatile channel that makes it hard to predict what style of UGC is best for a certain campaign.\\nSo, don’t be disappointed when you (inevitably) make mistakes.\\nInstead, learn from them. Test different approaches and see what works.\\nYou will eventually gain enough experience and start seeing patterns.\\nPro tip:\\nYou can also use our\\nfree TikTok mockup ad generators\\nto test different versions of your ads for free.\\n9. Scaling Your Campaign\\nThe typical timeline for our campaigns is three months.\\nThe first month is about finding the winning strategy and devising the best content.\\nWe run the paid ads during the second month and see what works.\\nMonth three is focused on massive scaling.\\nAfter testing different hooks and ads, we can confidently use what’s been proven to work.\\nSo, we rev our engines and push ahead with the most effective content to drive increased results.\\nPro tip:\\nDuring this stage of your campaign, you can also focus on leveraging other channels.\\nPost the winning TikTok UGC in marketing e-mails, on your website, or on other social platforms.\\nThis tactic will increase your brand visibility and drive more conversions.\\n5 Strategies to Get UGC on TikTok\\nThe strategies below allow you to engage a diverse range of audiences, from fashion enthusiasts and fitness buffs to tech geeks and travel lovers.\\nEach approach taps into the unique preferences of TikTok’s active users, fostering community engagement and building genuine connections through user-generated content.\\nThis creates an excellent opportunity for brands to enhance their digital marketing efforts and reach potential audiences in a more authentic and impactful way.\\nHashtag campaigns\\n: Launch branded hashtag challenges to encourage users to create and share content related to your brand. This strategy can increase visibility and engagement on social media platforms. Brands in the beauty, fashion, and lifestyle sectors can benefit greatly from these campaigns, as they appeal to users who enjoy participating in social media trends and expressing their creativity.\\nCollaborate with micro - influencers\\n: Partner with micro-influencers who have a loyal community. Their genuine content can drive more engagement and reach your target audience effectively. This approach is particularly beneficial for skincare products, fitness brands, and niche markets where influencers can create authentic content that resonates with their followers.\\nAnd apart from our own examples, Sephora offers a great application of long-term UGC by having created its \"Sephora Squad:\"\\n@sephora\\nThis is why we always say listen to your mom. @rachel 🦙\\n#SephoraSquad\\n♬ original sound - sephora\\nRun dance challenges\\n: Create dance moves related to your brand or product. These challenges often go viral, enhancing your brand’s presence on social media feeds. Dance challenges are ideal for brands targeting younger audiences, such as fashion, entertainment, and music-related products, where energetic and fun content can capture attention.\\nEncourage how-to videos\\n: Request users to share how-to videos demonstrating your product in action. This type of UGC provides valuable insights and helps potential customers make informed decisions. Brands offering beauty products, home improvement tools, and tech gadgets can leverage how-to videos to show their products’ effectiveness and ease of use.\\n\\u200d\\nHost competitions\\n: Organize competitions that reward the best user-generated content. This approach can boost content quality and encourage broader audience participation. Competitions are effective for brands across various industries, including sportswear, gaming, and travel, where competitive spirit and creativity can drive user engagement and generate high-quality UGC.\\n7 Best Types of UGC on TikTok\\nHere are the best types of UGC content you can include in your social advertising plan for this platform.\\nProduct reviews\\n: Users sharing their experiences with skincare products or beauty products can build trust and influence purchasing decisions. This type of content is particularly impactful for brands in the beauty and personal care sectors, as it provides genuine content and product feedback.\\nHow-to videos\\n: Tutorials and DIY content showing products in action provide valuable information to viewers. These videos are perfect for tech gadgets, home improvement tools, and fashion brands, helping potential customers make informed decisions by seeing the product in use.\\nReactions\\n: Videos capturing users\\' reactions to products or services can be highly engaging. This content type is effective for entertainment brands, tech products, and food items, where immediate and genuine user feedback can attract broader audiences.\\nBefore-and-after\\n: Transformation videos showcasing the impact of a product over time can be great for brands. Plus, it can lead to larger-scale partnerships if you\\'re using influencers. This type of UGC is ideal for fitness programs, skincare routines, and home décor brands, demonstrating the effectiveness and real-life results of the products.\\nA Day in the Life\\n: Videos that depict how users incorporate a brand’s products into their daily routines can create authentic connections. Lifestyle brands, fashion, and wellness products benefit from this type of content, as it highlights practical use and integrates products seamlessly into everyday life.\\nGRWM (Get Ready With Me)\\n: Users share their daily routines, often featuring beauty, fashion, or fitness products. This content type is highly effective for brands in these industries, showcasing products in an authentic and relatable context and encouraging community engagement through shared routines.\\nStorytelling videos\\n: Videos that tell a story about the user’s experience with a product create emotional connections and foster a sense of community. This type of content is versatile and can be used by any brand looking to build a loyal community and generate emotional connections with its audience.\\nCeraVe offers a solid example, mixing different types of TikTok videos into this how-to-storytelling-before-and-after success:\\n@amanda.makhaye\\n@DrTarrynDerm has taught me that acne-prone skin may be linked to a deficiency of ceramides in the skin. This is why it\\'s important for me to use products for acne-prone skin that also maintain and restore the skin\\'s barrier with essential ceramides. And that is why I love using the CeraVe Blemish Control range as it helps to gently exfoliate without disrupting your skin\\'s barrier.\\n#CeraVePartner\\n#CeraVe\\n#CeraVe_Africa\\n#ClearltUpLikeADerm\\n#CeraVeBlemishControl\\n♬ original sound - Amanda Makhaye\\nOur Growth Marketing Agency\\'s Tips for TikTok UGC Campaigns\\nEmbrace creative freedom\\n: Allow users the freedom to create original videos that align with their style. This leads to more authentic content. Remember that you\\'re not doing brand-created videos, but UGC TikTok videos.\\nFocus on community engagement\\n: Build a loyal community by interacting with users who participate in your UGC campaigns. Genuine connections are key to long-term success. So, praise their dance skills and encourage them to repost in their social feeds.\\nLeverage influencer strategy\\n: Partner with influencers who resonate with your brand.

If your ad can make people smile and associate positively with your brand, you're already halfway to winning their hearts. Fun ads do require a bit more creativity, but the payoff is worth it. After all, consumers are already feeling fatigued from the constant negativity that has flooded the online space in recent years. Witty humour can be a powerful tool to create engagement and reach, making your brand more relatable and memorable in the process.\\n\\n  \\n\\nA good example of a humorous ad with positive vibes is [Lidl’s campaign](/showcase/LIDL-Summer-20) created with our Creative Management Platform. The happy coconut is casually swimming in the ocean of high-quality products at reasonable prices inviting the clients to dive in too.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n2.  ### Generic/ One ad, wider audience\\n    \\n\\nAs data privacy concerns continue to rise, marketers may need to get a little more creative with their ad strategies. Instead of hyper-targeted ads, the trend is shifting towards more generic yet engaging ads that can appeal to a wider audience. So, it's not about making bland ads but creating ads that can resonate with a larger group of people.\\n\\n  \\n\\nOne example of a brand with generic banner ads is Coca-Cola. They often use simple and generic designs with their iconic red and white colours and their logo prominently displayed. These ads are not targeting any specific audience but rather casting a wide net to appeal to a broad range of consumers. The focus of their ads is often on their brand message of happiness and refreshment, rather than a specific product or service.\\n\\n  \\n\\n3.  ### Retro/ Flashback to the old days\\n    \\n\\nThe nostalgia trend continues in 2023, and we expect brands to use retro elements in their ad designs. Bright colors, textured backgrounds, simple designs, and expressive fonts are just a few ways to bring a nostalgic feel to your ad. Just check out the [examples here](https://www.designstack.co/2014/08/retro-vintage-ads-for-social-media.html) for inspiration. Did you go back in time? Because we definitely did!\\n\\n  \\n\\n4.  ### Nature/ Eco-friendly ad design\\n    \\n\\nAs consumers become more environmentally conscious, brands must adapt their advertising strategies. Brands that frame themselves as eco-friendly using blues and earth tones can definitely appeal to this growing market.\\n\\n  \\n\\nPatagonia sets a remarkable example of integrating eco-friendly ad design into its advertising strategy. Their ads showcase breathtaking landscapes, while their commitment to using recycled and sustainable materials in their products has helped establish them as leaders in eco-friendly fashion and outdoor gear.\\n\\n  \\n\\n5.  ### Effectiveness/ Ad scoring\\n    \\n\\nAd scoring is a trend that's gaining traction in the advertising industry, especially as companies face budget cuts and want to ensure that their ad campaigns are successful. Ad scoring involves evaluating various qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the potential performance of an ad before it's published. For instance, a company may use ad scoring to assess the effectiveness of a particular ad concept based on factors such as the target audience, the ad's messaging, the call-to-action, the creative elements, and the overall impact on brand awareness and sales. By using ad scoring, companies can make data-driven decisions about their ad campaigns and optimize their marketing strategies for better results.\\n\\n  \\n\\nA real-life example of ad scoring is the recent campaign by Amazon for their Alexa product. The company created multiple ads and tested them across multiple platforms, analyzing which ones resonated with the target audience the most. By using ad scoring, Amazon created ads that delivered better results and increased sales.\\n\\n  \\n\\nIf you need help with creating and testing multiple designs for your next campaign but also want to save time and resources, see how [Streameye’s Creative Management Platform](/features) can give you a push.\\n\\n  \\n\\n6.  ### AI-generated art\\n    \\n\\nAI-generated art is becoming increasingly popular in the creative industry, and more businesses are expected to incorporate it into their workflows in 2023. This technology allows for efficient design processes, and even those without formal design skills can create visually stunning artwork with the help of algorithms. AI-generated art can come in various forms such as images, videos, and music, and it uses complex mathematical computations and machine learning to analyze and replicate patterns in existing artwork. It has the potential to revolutionize the creative industry and make design more accessible to everyone. Here are a few examples of how [AI can be used in marketing and advertising](https://blog.socialmediastrategiessummit.com/10-examples-of-ai-in-marketing/).\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\nDo you agree with these trends?

In it, more than 2 100 marketers shared their outlook on how they use social media to grow and promote their brands. The results of the study shed light on various topics, including:\\n  \\n\\n-   The advantages of Social media marketing: how social media helps achieve digital marketing goals and how the years of expertise give the upper hand\\n    \\n-   These are the platforms that not only promise but deliver the best exposure, leads, traffic, sales, and client loyalty.\\n    \\n-   Marketers’ favourite social media platforms: how they have been using them so far and their strategic plans for the future\\n    \\n-   Organic reach: how marketers leverage organic activities\\n    \\n-   Video marketing: where videos reach a wider audience and sell more\\n    \\n-   Social Media paid advertising: marketers’ most used platforms\\n    \\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## A Quick Overview of the Study’s Findings\\n\\n  \\n\\nFacebook continues to lose its position as the social media giant. Since 2018, marketers have been slowly but steadily switching to other platforms. Since then, their interest in Facebook as a favourite way to connect to clients has declined from 67% to 45%. Only 37% of marketers who took part in the study stated their plans to increase organic activities on Facebook.\\n\\n  \\n\\nDespite this, Facebook's dominance remains strong. An overwhelming 89% of marketers utilize Facebook, with Instagram following closely at 80%. For 45% of marketers, Facebook ranks as their most crucial social platform. Additionally, 67% of them employ Facebook ads, and nearly half (45%) consider the Facebook platform the most pivotal for their advertising efforts. Moreover, Facebook stands out for driving the highest traffic and making the most significant contribution to sales.\\n\\n  \\n\\nYouTube is gaining power. Almost 70% of digital marketers expressed their interest in learning more about organic video reach on the platform and about 60% of them plan on increasing their usage of YouTube video.\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstagram remains a highly favoured social media platform, maintaining its status as one of the top choices among marketers. Alongside YouTube, it continues to attract considerable attention and curiosity in the marketing realm, with 56% of marketers planning to increase their Instagram organic activities.\\n\\n  \\n\\nTikTok is also on the rise. The adoption of TikTok among marketers increased from 18% in 2022 to 22% in 2023. A noteworthy 38% have intentions to boost their engagement on the platform and a substantial 48% express interest in gaining more knowledge about TikTok.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## Here is the Deep Dive into the Report\\n\\nThe study begins by addressing key questions and common challenges faced by digital marketers, with a primary focus on enhancing sales and generating leads, a priority for over 50% of marketers. Other significant objectives include increasing brand exposure, cultivating a broad base of loyal followers, and boosting traffic to the brand's official platforms.\\n\\n  \\n\\n## Social Media Presence: Benefits for the business\\n\\n  \\n\\nAround 86% of marketers affirmed that their social media efforts have significantly amplified their business exposure and have increased the traffic to the brand’s platforms by 76%. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that marketers with 2 or more years of social media experience demonstrate better sales results. Most of them attribute their success to platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These are also the two leading platforms that they count on to develop a loyal fanbase.\\n\\n  \\n\\nWhen it comes to generating leads, things look a bit different. Here leading platforms are Facebook and LinkedIn.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## Preference of Social Media Platforms: B2C & B2B\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe most commonly used platforms remain Facebook and Instagram, with TikTok notably gaining power, with growth from 18% in 2022 to 22% in 2023.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe most favourite channels for B2C marketers are Facebook and Instagram, followed by Linkedin, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok.\\n\\n  \\n\\nOn the other hand, the most preferred channel for B2B marketers is LinkedIn, closely followed by Facebook Instagram, and the rest of the social media platforms. B2B marketers’ interest in Facebook and Instagram dropped from 51% in 2022 to 43% in 2023.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## What About Organic Reach Strategies?\\n\\n  \\n\\nAbout 14% of marketers have indicated their decreased interest in Facebook when it comes to organic reach activities, while a significant 37% have stated the opposite - they will be still counting on Facebook as the most important platform for user engagement. 43% of them are not going to take active measures to change their digital strategies.\\n\\n  \\n\\nIn the meantime, 56% of marketers are turning to Instagram to boost their organic reach. 59% of B2C marketers express plans to increase their Instagram presence, compared to 52% of B2B.\\n\\n  \\n\\nFor YouTube, around 63% of marketers will work on increasing organic reach. For LinkedIn, the number is 55%, for TikTok - 38%, and for Twitter - 16%.\\n\\n  \\n\\nMarketers were asked about the social media platforms they are eager to gain more knowledge about. Instagram maintained its top position for the fifth consecutive year, while Facebook slipped to the fourth spot, trailing behind LinkedIn.\\n\\n  \\n\\nNotably, B2C marketers exhibit greater interest in learning about Instagram and Facebook compared to their B2B colleagues. Meanwhile, B2B marketers display a significantly higher interest in acquiring insights about LinkedIn.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## Which Social Media Platform is Favourite for Video?\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe study indicates that marketers are planning to turn to video marketing. They show the most interest in Instagram videos (66%), YouTube videos (66%), and Facebook videos (53%). As YouTube and Instagram topped the list of video platforms, interest in Facebook has dropped from 63% in 2022 to 57% in 2023.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAgain, there is a slight difference between B2B and B2C. B2C marketers are more open to diving into Instagram videos (72% B2C vs. 59% B2B) and Facebook videos (62% B2C vs. 49% B2B). On the flip side, B2B marketers show a stronger interest in understanding LinkedIn videos (65% B2B vs. 44% B2C).\\n\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n## What About Paid Advertising?\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe ad platform most used by marketers for paid advertising is Facebook (67%), followed by Instagram (52%). B2C marketers are more likely to use Facebook ads (71% B2C vs. 61% B2B) while B2B marketers are prone to using LinkedIn ads (39% B2B vs. 17% B2C).\\n\\n  \\n\\nEven though most marketers pointed out Facebook as their preferred platform for paid ads, the usage percentage has dropped from 51% in 2022 to 46% in 2023. Interestingly, the overall interest in paid social ads has increased from 22% to 25%.\\n\\n  \\n\\nWhen marketers had to identify the platform they wanted to get more insights about, Instagram took first place with 60%. B2C marketers showed consistent interest in Facebook and Instagram, while their B2B counterparts kept their focus on LinkedIn.\\n\\n  \\n\\nWe hope you found these findings as interesting and insightful as we did!

While the banner creation process may seem straightforward, manually creating them at scale is an extremely involved process.\\n\\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the intricate details of banner creation, it can be impossible to choose the right software for your team.From concepts to design to copy, we’ve broken down the most important elements for choosing the best banner software.\\n\\nWhat’s involved in creating ad banners?\\nMany software products promise to empower your marketers and designers, but if you’re a CMO or marketing manager, you might not be familiar with all of the details that go into banner creation.\\n\\nMarketing teams develop concepts and copy, followed by designers who create dozens of different variations (both in terms of content and dimensions). It’s crucial that teams keep a close eye on file sizes to ensure that their banners are not only accepted by publishing platforms but also load quicker than the competition.\\n\\n## What StreamEye offers digital businesses\\n\\nThe right software – like StreamEye – is proven to [save dozens of working hours every month](/blog/What_If_Your_Team_Members_Had_Extra_5_Hours) while empowering your marketing and design teams.\\n\\n## Scalability\\n\\nHow many banners do you need to create and what does scaling look like for your company? When your business environment changes and you need to react quickly with new ads to take advantage, understanding your precise scaling needs will make an enormous difference.\\n\\nThe best banner software automates as much of this process as possible, allowing teams to produce large numbers of custom banners with minimal delay for development and coordination. Specifically, you’ll want to choose software that automatically generates differently-sized banners and unique banner content – both of which we’ll explore in greater detail below.\\n\\n## Quickly & easily change content in multiple banner sizes\\n\\nThere’s nothing particularly complex about it, but it’s one of the most overlooked aspects of banner creation: You design a banner and then need it sized for use across multiple platforms and media types.\\n\\nThe reality? It quickly turns into a burdensome exercise. For example, you may have 10 different content variations and require 10 different sizes for each. You’re asking designers to manually create 100 unique banners. The required time drive up costs and leave your company unable to meet the demand for other new campaigns.\\n\\nInstead of days (or even weeks), the right banner software can create those 100 unique banners within minutes.\\n\\n## Easy to access libraries\\n\\nIn addition to a wide variety of banners, your company might struggle to manage the dozens of images, videos, and other media in your library of content. Having a strong user interface to navigate, organise, and use this content makes an enormous difference in the day-to-day running of campaigns.\\n\\nEven for simpler operations that don’t require much media, [testing different banners](https://www.niche.com/about/enrollment-insights/a-guide-to-digital-marketing-experimentation-and-optimization-in-education/) for different purposes should be carried out regularly.

That's why many enterprise brands are turning to animated skins, HTML 5 banners that can be placed on websites with a dedicated space for them. These animated skins can be easily created and positioned on various websites, offering a unique and eye-catching way to reach target audiences.\\n\\nAnimated skins are increasingly being used by advertisers to make their online campaigns more visually appealing and interactive. These skins are essentially background wallpapers that can be used to display ads without interfering with the site’s original content.\\n\\nWhile [takeover skins](/blog/Takeover_Skins_And_Responsive_Banners) have been around for years, they have recently gained attention due to their effectiveness. In fact, many advertisers are turning to takeover skins to make their ads more engaging and memorable.\\n\\n\\n## Isn’t that just a takeover skin?\\n\\nTakeover skins are generally static, but it is possible to create dynamic ones with tools like StreamEye. They are generally created to take advantage of full HD resolution (1920x1080) and are designed to fit the dimensions of the site’s content. However, takeover skins are generally aimed at desktop users because there just isn’t a good way to display content on the margins for a tall and narrow phone screen.\\n\\nResponsive banners, on the other hand, are a newer format that is quickly gaining popularity. Unlike takeover skins, responsive banners are able to automatically adjust to the size of the screen on which they’re viewed. They can function on mobile screens as well as desktops and tablets. However, this does put some limits on the use of animations within the ad because those animations need to work no matter the screen size.\\n\\nOnce you combine the takeover skin placeholder with the responsive banner functions, there comes her majesty, the animated skin, which we are discussing in today’s post.\\n  \\n\\n## The Power of Animated Skins\\n\\nAnimated skins offer a powerful way for brands to make their ads stand out from the competition. With dynamic elements that catch the eye and increase engagement, animated skins can help brands achieve higher retention rates and better ROI. They also offer a way for brands to create campaigns that are more memorable, as they leave a lasting impression on viewers.\\n \\n\\n## The Benefits of Using Animated Skins in Big Ad Campaigns\\n\\nOne of the biggest benefits of animated skins is that animated skins are simply more visually appealing than traditional banner ads. With their dynamic elements and eye-catching designs, animated skins can grab the attention of viewers and encourage them to engage with the ad.\\n\\nAnd while animated skins may be more expensive than traditional HTML5 banners, their effectiveness in engaging audiences makes them a worthwhile investment for bigger campaigns or more specialized ad campaigns.\\n\\nAnother benefit of animated skins is that they offer API integration, which allows viewers to interact with the ad in different ways. For example, viewers can click on elements within the ad to change its behavior or to trigger different events as well as receive up-to-date information about the product offering. This level of interactivity offers a brilliant new way for brands to engage with their target audiences and create more personalized experiences.\\n\\nFinally, animated skins are fully responsive, meaning they can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This makes them ideal for campaigns that need to reach audiences across different devices and platforms.\\n\\nIf you are aware of all the benefits of such a powerful tool like the animated skins but don’t know how to streamline the creative process for your brand, it is highly probable that you are [ready to implement a CMP](/blog/does_your_business_need_a_cmp_now) as part of your marketing efforts.

And you may be thinking that this sounds great but do you still find it difficult to imagine how a tool like this can be integrated into your team’s daily efforts?\\n\\nBefore diving in, maybe you would like to read our [creative management platform fundamentals piece](/blog/Creative_Management_Platform_When_You_Need_One) first.\\n\\n## How a creative management tool maximizes the efficiency in banner creation for successful brands?\\n\\nAnd so what do creative management tools do to actually help us, marketers? Here’s a list of the most important aspects of working with a CMP in 2023:\\n\\n### It saves time\\n\\nCMP tools help brands go to market in a matter of minutes. They help automate ad production by integrating dynamic data into the ads and updating the display ads quickly and easily. They can produce engaging HTML5 animated ads with the brand’s latest promotions, thus helping their fast communication. And all of this, essentially, saves time.\\n\\n### It saves money\\n\\nUsing a CMP could often help decrease production costs and increase ROI. It is a tool that has the potential to make your marketing self-provisioned when deploying new offers live. And isn’t it an essential part of our job to acquire more leads at a cheaper cost? We bet there is not a single one of you here who doesn’t want better efficiency. Creative management tools can help us achieve it easily.\\n\\n### It frees up resources\\n\\nSacrificing a big part of your best designers’ time to repetitive and tedious tasks is always something good managers try to avoid. CMPs’ automation and creative possibilities free up your team’s time for tasks that are more strategic, creative and inspirational. Let your designer team (be it internal or outsourced) do what they are good at - creating new concepts, working on inspiring projects and exploring their creativity. Let the CMP free up their time for the good stuff.\\n\\n### It helps you create asset galleries with easy access\\n\\nGood CMPs create for your brand a resource bank that can be easily reused across digital ads. You can feed and update the asset bank with relevant imagery at your convenience. The platform provides you with everything ready all in one place with a click of a distance. Best creative management platform providers also offer the feature to connect galleries to APIs to automate image selection in ads. And that is really powerful.\\n\\n### It can help you gain full creative production autonomy\\n\\nIf you feel like you want to make creative work more flexible and agile, you may benefit from a tool that requires less effort from your team. In-housing your creative production is not just more cost-effective – it allows you to become more responsive to market changes and your competitors' actions. With Streameye, you can tweak creatives, update messaging, and change your offers in a matter of minutes, without the help of a developer or even a senior designer. Your custom templates and vast visual library mean you can push that offer out when you see fit – and not a minute later.\\n\\n### It streamlines and optimizes the production processes\\n\\nGood creative management platforms multiply the creative production quickly and effortlessly. Configuring the CMP according to your company’s flows and processes, brands often find a lot of room for improvement. It’s not rare that they get inspired by the platform’s features to optimize their own production process and recreate it to serve them better. With Streameye, you get expert advice and support that will elevate your creative abilities even further. Streameye doesn't just bring you creative templates fit for your brand. Our team will be there to help you get the most out of the platform from the start and stay up to date with the latest digital creative technology.

And as much as it’s good if the creative management tool can work according to your internal process flows, it can also be of great help in optimizing it and making it work even better for the company.\\n\\n### It expands the creative resources and marketing assets\\n\\nUsing a CMP can easily empower your marketing team to use formats that usually take more time and effort to create in-house. An example of that could be creating [video ads](/blog/Power_Of_Video_Ads) without blocking any motion team resources for the purpose. Another example could be using [takeover skins or responsive banners](/blog/Takeover_Skins_And_Responsive_Banners) that the team hasn’t prioritized testing out.\\n\\nHaving a professional CMP partner in your company can help get an edge over your competitors with always relevant content. Additionally, it inspires with templates and/or seasonal campaign ideas that you can consider, plan and execute within the blink of an eye.\\n\\n## Do CMPs help in keeping full control over brand consistency?\\n\\nThey are and they’d better.\\n\\nOne characteristic feature of all good creative management platforms is the ability to ensure brand consistency and approved on-brand-only resource use.\\n\\nChoosing a good CMP will also help you get full control over your digital campaigns and create ads that always feel and look like you.\\n\\nAt Streameye, for example, your pre-approved creative templates will consistently maintain your brand style for you. You can lock different creative elements to ensure they stay put across all ads. By doing that, you make sure certain aspects of the branding remain always the same and you simply stop worrying about them.\\n\\nTrusting a CMP tool will oftentimes help you skip the tedious approval back-and-forth with custom creative templates and pre-approved assets that fit your brand. With a good CMP by your side, you are to keep full control of how elements can be changed and eliminate any inconsistencies across your ads. Your team will be able to design dynamic creatives with high impact and you will keep your peace of mind knowing all brand guidelines and industry requirements are kept in check.\\n\\n## Can we use creative management tools without sacrificing the quality or quantity of produced marketing material?\\n\\nNot only!\\n\\nHaving creative management software in your toolset, you will be able to multiply your creative work into different formats and sizes in a matter of seconds. You will be able to dynamically change campaign details within a click of a time.\\n\\nYou will also have access to a lot of templates and other forms of inspiration (e.g. seasonal campaigns).

Test these out and get the most out of them for your company.

All you need is for them to work together to grow your business.\\n\\n_But it’s never that simple._\\n\\nEffective collaboration requires more than just talent: Your marketing and design teams need the right attitude, systems and tools to be effective. Below, we break down the three key areas where you can make an impact to get better results for your business – and how StreamEye makes that possible.\\n\\n## 1. Minimising handoffs\\n\\nNo one likes handoffs, but when your marketing involves creating visuals like banner ads at scale, it seems inevitable. Once you start talking about multiple ads in seemingly endless sizes, various languages and changing offers, there’s an immense amount of back and forth between marketing and design teams.\\n\\nThe key is to use a tool like StreamEye which empowers marketers to take a single design and modify it independently. When the design team only needs to create a single base design (which the marketers can then use to their heart’s content), back and forth between teams is greatly reduced.\\n\\n## 2. Accountability\\n\\nSpeaking of empowering marketing teams, placing more capabilities in their hands is critical for greater accountability. Consider when a mistake ends up in a final ad: who gets the blame? Is it the marketer (who didn’t effectively communicate what had to happen) or the designer (who didn’t ask themselves “is this what marketing wants?”)?\\n\\nIn a world with plenty of handoffs, it’s also easy to pass off the blame when something goes wrong. Giving marketing teams more capabilities to independently create and modify ads means greater accountability. Ultimately, [teams that are accountable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2016/12/08/why-accountability-is-critical-for-achieving-winning-results/) are teams that perform better.\\n\\nStreamEye prevents the “it’s not my fault” conversation by giving marketing teams tools to operate more independently with existing designs.\\n\\n## 3. Meaningful work from both ends\\n\\nImagine you’re a designer and are told to take a basic design and create 120 versions of it in 4 languages, 10 designs, and 4 offers.\\n\\nDesigners don’t want to spend their days doing menial tasks like generating dozens of slightly different versions of the same image. Worse, it hurts their productivity.\\n\\nIf your designers are spending their time developing more impactful designs, they’re going to enjoy their work better and produce better results. Better still, when your designers only need to focus on their main work, you’ll need fewer working hours from them.\\n\\nStreamEye automates work that once took hours, ensuring that your marketing and design teams can be more focused on impactful work.\\n\\n## 4. Responsiveness\\n\\nWhen you’re in a fast-changing industry, your marketing team may occasionally need to make critical adjustments to their ads ASAP. Being held up by waiting on designers to make updates is a poor recipe for good collaboration.\\n\\nAvoid wasting golden opportunities (and the need to involve designers) during these critical moments. It is StreamEye's core mission to make your marketers more effective and give your designers a break from playing robots.\\n\\n## StreamEye streamlines marketing and design work\\n\\nThe right tool makes team collaboration far easier, and that’s why StreamEye was created: to make productive collaboration seamless.

This phenomenon has a name and it is retargeting, also referred to as remarketing. It is nothing fancy, just sound technology at play.\\n\\n  \\n\\nRetargeting is a technique in the action arsenal of every experienced digital marketer. It is a marketing strategy that allows businesses to retarget and show relevant ads to users that have previously clicked on their ad or have visited the business’s website without completing a desired action, most often a purchase.\\n\\n  \\n\\nIt is all possible thanks to the so-called cookies that help with tracking users’ behaviour on the business’s website and then allow for the delivery of targeted ads while they browse other sites or social media platforms.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe sole purpose of retargeting is to get back in front of people and remind them that they have been interested in the business’s products or services. This increases the likelihood that these people will return to the website and complete a purchase, converting them into customers.\\n\\n  \\n\\nRetargeting is a powerful tool that requires a smart and creative approach. The reason is that every user exhibits different behaviour, visits different pages, and is interested in different products depending on their needs or current mood. Not all undecided users will respond and will be persuaded by the same message. For example, you run a discount on winter clothing. One user checks out a pair of leather boots and directly leaves the website, while another adds a winter coat to his cart, but does not finish the purchase. You will need to come up with at least two unique ads.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThis is why every retargeting campaign has to be carefully premeditated and crafted with the right message and design. A good [creative management platform](/features) gives you an advantage in creating banner ads for your retargeting campaigns because it gives you the flexibility to create as many visuals as you need at reduced cost and optimized time. Check out our [portfolio](/showcase) to get an idea of what designs your marketing team can create.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n# How does retargeting help your business?\\n\\n  \\n\\n[Research](https://www.gosquared.com/blog/retargeting-visitors#:~:text=For%20most%20websites%2C%20only%202,have%20visited%20your%20website%20before.) suggests that only 2% of visitors make a purchase the first time they visit your website. Don’t let the growth of your business to chance. Get the attention of the rest 98% and remind them of the benefits of your products or services.\\n\\n  \\n\\n-   ### Increase your conversion rates\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\nRetargeting can help businesses boost their conversion rates by retargeting the right people with the right message. Selling your products and services to someone who is already familiar with them and has shown interest is much easier than turning a completely new audience into paying customers.\\n\\n  \\n\\n-   ### Boost brand awareness\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\nRetargeting can also be used to build brand awareness and familiarity. This will make your brand more recognizable than the competition and will close the gap between you and the consumers. Don’t forget that people prefer to use the products and services of brands that they know and trust.\\n\\n  \\n\\n-   ### Create upselling and cross-selling opportunities\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\nRetargeting can also be used to promote related products or services to people who have already made a purchase. Often, customers access your site with a specific idea in mind but don’t realize that an additional accessory can be very useful. For example, someone just bought a new phone from you but forgot to get a screen protector, a phone case, or a selfie stick. By showing them ads for complementary products, businesses can increase their revenue and customer lifetime value.\\n\\n  \\n\\n-   ### Get people to return to their abandoned carts\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\nStudies show that about 2/3 of shoppers leave the site without finishing their purchase. Retargeting gives you the potential to win those people back and turn them into buying customers. If you feel like it, you could even offer them a coupon discount or a gift if they complete their purchase within 24h.\\n\\n  \\n\\nLaunching effective display retargeting campaigns is crucial for the success of every business.

It’s become a [ubiquitous tool](https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-platforms/video-marketing/video-marketing-statistics-to-know/) because of its persuasiveness and ability to hold viewer interest. At StreamEye, we’ve been determining precisely how to assist our users in exporting their video file formats to banners.\\n\\nAfter countless tests, we’ve finally unlocked a new way for you to advertise and communicate with your audiences. Let’s look into what this new functionality looks like, why it’s so powerful and what you can do with it.\\n\\n## Why video banners are a game changer\\n\\nFrom social networks to ecommerce platforms, consumers have come to expect video content. Ads like static banners just don’t perform the way they used to. In fact, one study by Tubular Insights found a [400-700% increase in CTR](https://tubularinsights.com/video-ads-more-effective/). Considering the inputs needed (more on that later), this can translate into an incredible boost in ROI for your advertising.\\n\\nSo while video has opened up a world of possibilities for advertisers on platforms like Youtube, video in social network advertising has been limited. This is because these networks don’t accept HTML5 banners with video embedded.\\n\\n### Bringing the power of video to more platforms and channels\\n\\nExporting video file formats from StreamEye was a natural way to provide our clients with a more powerful omni-channel marketing production platform. This will enable StreamEye users to do more to boost efficiency, simplify training and explore new ways to market your products and services.\\n\\n### How we’ve brought video to StreamEye users\\n\\nSo how do you create video banners within StreamEye? We’ve worked hard to ensure you can use the same familiar asset structure for static or HTML5 banners. This means you can select – or even mix and match – different offers within the same ad by using your searchable galleries.\\n\\nAlthough video is undoubtedly more complex, StreamEye’s ease-of-use is still there. Our incorporation of AWS makes creating video ads at scale simple and intuitive.\\n\\nYou don’t have to sacrifice functionality to start working with video banners: Our powerful text formatting and fitting capabilities apply just as much to video.\\n\\nLastly, not all video is created equal, but you’ll never have to sacrifice quality or flexibility when producing yours. Video sources and audio clips can be seamlessly integrated in our platform to produce highly-engaging animated video ads. The only thing holding you back is your imagination.\\n\\n### What you can expect from bringing video to your banners\\n\\nAlongside our HTML5 ads and static ads for email and social networks, our video banner options open up new possibilities for your online advertising. If you’re already a StreamEye Professional client, the video module is a free ad-on and there aren’t any new systems to learn.\\n\\nIf you’re new to StreamEye, you’ll discover that our system for building and running stronger banner ads at scale is easy to learn and surprisingly powerful.\\n\\nWhat are you waiting for?

For decades, the federal government prohibited the practice and therefore it was only legal in a few states. In 2018, however, the US Supreme Court reversed this ban, paving the way for individual states to legalize sportsbooks.\\n\\nAs of 2022, more than half of the country has already initiated the process of legalizing sports betting.\\n\\nMany regulated states limit in-game advertising to just advertising for casinos and prohibit advertisements during televised sporting events until after 9 p.m., depending on the type of game being aired (or earlier). Some states require websites to obtain a license before operating within their jurisdiction; others rely on federal regulations instead.\\n\\n## What changed in 2018?\\n\\nIn 2018, the US Supreme Court reversed the federal ban on sports betting, thus allowing individual states to legalize sportsbooks.\\n\\nOn May 14, 2018, the US Supreme Court ruled that individual states may decide whether or not to legalize sports betting. The ruling overturned a 1992 federal law that banned sports betting except in four states.\\n\\nThis decision opened the door for states to regulate sports betting themselves and could be considered a major win for those who want to see legal sportsbooks opened across the country.\\n\\n## What happened next?\\n\\nIn 2019, 10 states had legalized sports betting and another 13 had their legislation pending.\\n\\nThe first states to legalize sports betting were New Jersey, Mississippi and West Virginia and the ones coming right after included Pennsylvania, Texas, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Rhode Island. In addition to the above states, Puerto Rico had also passed legislation that would allow for regulated online gaming.\\n\\n## How about now?\\n\\nAs of November 2022, sports betting in the US has expanded to over 30 states and counting. A state-by-state breakdown is available for information in [this CBS Sports article.](https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/u-s-sports-betting-heres-where-all-50-states-stand-on-legalizing-sports-gambling-latest-mobile-bets/) If you are curious about legal details, [Legal Sports Report has tracked](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/sportsbetting-bill-tracker/) quite thoroughly the bills on file and the new laws on the books.\\n\\nSeveral states have turned to online and now allow remote registration. This means anyone can sign up from their couch and immediately start betting with several of the top online sportsbook options in the country. All of this is possible thanks to these states opening up partnerships between the states' casinos and experienced operators to join up to create a top-notch sports betting product. And of course, that also leads us to advertising.\\n\\n## Advertising limitations\\n\\n### In-game advertising and advertising for casinos\\n\\nMany regulated states limit in-game advertising to just advertising for casinos. There are two main reasons for this:\\n\\n-   Players may be more likely to make impulsive bets when they see a brand or product they like, and\\n    \\n-   Regulators want to protect their states from being overwhelmed with sports betting if it becomes legalized nationwide.\\n    \\n\\n### TV advertising only after 9 p.m. but digital is here to stay\\n\\nIn the United States, several states have legalized different forms of sports betting. For example, New Jersey has legalized both casinos and online gambling.\\n\\nHowever, there is still one major restriction on advertising during televised sporting events: it cannot appear until after 9 p.m., depending on the state and the type of game being aired. This means that you will not be able to see any commercials featuring people placing bets during your favorite televised sporting events such as football or baseball games.\\n\\nThe States still give companies wide latitude over what they can say in advertisements though - quite a different approach compared to the one towards the tobacco industry for example. For the time being, there seem to be no major advertising rules specific to the sports betting industry at the federal level. Having such limited oversight in terms of ad regulation, digital is here to help anyone who knows how to benefit from it.\\n\\n  \\n\\n### License Regime\\n\\nMany states require operators to obtain a license before operating in the state. In some cases, this requirement only applies to operators of sports betting websites; other states have a similar requirement for players as well. Some states also have additional requirements for operators and players depending on what type of game they're playing or where the player is located.\\n\\n## Sports betting rules are specific to each state's jurisdiction\\n\\nThe laws that govern sports betting in the United States are specific to each individual state's jurisdiction. As of right now, there are no federal laws regarding sports betting, so it's up to each state to decide how they want to regulate it. The laws governing sports betting will change from state to state, and it's important for gamblers who live in states where such changes have taken place (or are taking place) to do their research before placing any bets.\\n\\nThe speed at which these laws are changing varies from one area of the country to another - in some places, there have been recent updates within the past few months. In contrast, other states such as Illinois have had virtually no visible movement since the legalization was passed back in 1992.\\n\\nTo conclude, sports betting is already legal in most US states and continues to expand throughout the country. The market is expected to multiply as more states legalize sportsbooks, which will increase consumer demand for advertising, especially on the digital side.\\n\", 'short_copy': 'In 2018, the US Supreme Court reversed the sports betting ban, paving the way for individual states to legalize sportsbooks.

What are some common pain points that retailers face when trying to create effective ad campaigns on the platform?\\n\\nAlso, how does Streameye's toolset specifically address these challenges and enable retailers to create high-quality, branded content without requiring extensive design or development expertise?\\nAI: The rise of DIY ads on TikTok is an exciting trend for retailers looking to boost their digital advertising efforts. According to recent reports, [1] https://www.datafeedwatch.com/blog/best-tiktok-ad-examples, many retailers are struggling with creating effective ad campaigns on the platform due to a lack of creative resources and expertise.\\n\\nOne common pain point is the need for high-quality video content that resonates with TikTok's younger audience. Retailers often find it challenging to produce engaging videos that showcase their products in an authentic and compelling way. Additionally, they may struggle with understanding how to effectively use TikTok's various ad formats, such as Video Shopping Ads and TopView Ads.\\n\\nStreameye's toolset can help alleviate these challenges by providing retailers with branded templated videos that can be easily customized to fit their brand identity. This means that retailers don't need extensive design or development expertise to create high-quality content that resonates with TikTok users. By leveraging Streameye's pre-designed templates, retailers can focus on creating engaging ad campaigns that drive real results.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] https://www.datafeedwatch.com/blog/best-tiktok-ad-examples\\nHuman: That's really helpful to know. Can you tell me more about the types of DIY ads that are performing well on TikTok? Are there any specific ad formats or creative strategies that retailers should be using to maximize their reach and engagement?\\n\\nFor example, are short-form videos with catchy music and text overlays still effective, or are there other formats like interactive ads or live streaming that are gaining traction? Any insights you can share would be super helpful in crafting a compelling narrative for our blog post.\\nAI: When it comes to DIY ads on TikTok, retailers are finding success with short-form videos that are visually engaging and authentic. According to [2] https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/quicktok/online/tiktok_creative_accelerator/pc/en, using catchy music and text overlays is still a winning strategy for capturing users' attention.\\n\\nHowever, retailers should also consider experimenting with other formats like interactive ads and live streaming. For instance, [3] https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/creative-best-practices?lang=en suggests that leaning into trends and challenges can make ads feel more relevant and engaging to TikTok users.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Awareness category on TikTok includes the Reach objective, which serves video ads to the largest possible audience on the platform. This objective is ideal for advertisers looking to increase brand awareness and expand their reach on the platform [4] https://leadsbridge.com/blog/tiktok-advertising/.\\n\\nStreameye's toolset can help retailers create high-quality, branded content that incorporates these creative strategies, making it easier for them to maximize their reach and engagement on TikTok.\\n\\nSources:\\n[2] https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/quicktok/online/tiktok_creative_accelerator/pc/en\\n[3] https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/creative-best-practices?lang=en\\n[4] https://leadsbridge.com/blog/tiktok-advertising/\", 'title': \"The Rise of DIY Ads: How Retailers Can Tap into TikTok's Creative Potential and Boost Their Digital Advertising Efforts\", 'rationale': \"This title is attention-grabbing because it emphasizes the 'do-it-yourself' aspect of creating ads on TikTok.

      "**Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation revolves around the current trends in using TikTok for digital advertising, specifically focusing on user-generated content (UGC) and branded masterpieces. The expert highlights that UGC has become a powerful tool for retailers to create authentic and engaging ad campaigns, but creating effective UGC can be challenging due to scaling and consistency issues. Additionally, retailers face pain points such as creating high-quality, branded content that resonates with their target audience.\n",

This can save retailers time and resources while ensuring consistency across all ad campaigns.\n",

A staggering 70% of marketers report that creating content is their biggest challenge, highlighting the need for efficient solutions. Whether it\\'s creating multiple versions of images for different social media platforms or generating unique videos for marketing campaigns, the demand for efficient and consistent content creation has never been higher. However, achieving this without compromising on quality can be a daunting task.\\n\\nThis article explores how enterprise brands can overcome these challenges by leveraging advanced tools like StreamEye, which not only streamlines the production process but also ensures that creativity and quality remain at the forefront.\\n\\n## The Challenge of Mass-Producing Digital Assets\\n\\nBefore diving into solutions, it\\'s essential to understand what mass-producing digital assets entails. According to marketing experts, this refers to efficiently creating and distributing a high volume of content in various formats and sizes for different channels and platforms [1]. This can include resizing images for social media or email marketing, as well as producing unique assets like short-form videos for TikTok or Instagram Reels.\\n\\nEnterprise brands often face several pain points when trying to produce digital assets at scale:\\n\\n- **Time-Consuming Manual Processes**: Manually creating and editing each asset is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As one industry expert noted, \"The manual process can drain resources and slow down campaigns.\"\\n- **Lack of Resources**: Small teams or limited budgets can hinder the production of high-quality content at the required volume.\\n- **Inconsistent Branding**: Without a centralized system, maintaining brand consistency across all channels becomes challenging [2].\\n- **Difficulty in Scaling Creative Work**: As businesses grow, their creative needs expand, but internal teams may not be equipped to handle increased demand.\\n\\nThese challenges can lead to delayed campaigns, reduced brand consistency, and decreased customer engagement. To address these issues effectively, brands need a robust solution that combines automation, customization, and seamless collaboration.\\n\\n## StreamEye: A Solution for Enterprise Brands\\n\\nStreamEye emerges as a powerful platform designed specifically to meet the needs of enterprise brands looking to scale their digital asset production while maintaining quality. By integrating automation, customization, and collaboration features, StreamEye offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by marketers.\\n\\n### Automation Capabilities\\n\\nOne of the standout features of StreamEye is its automation capabilities. The platform allows users to automate repetitive tasks such as resizing images or generating social media posts. This not only saves time but also frees up creative teams to focus on more strategic and innovative work [3].\\n\\nFor instance, with StreamEye\\'s automation tools, marketers can quickly generate multiple versions of an image for different platforms without manual intervention. This efficiency ensures that content is delivered on time while maintaining high standards.\\n\\n### Customization Options\\n\\nCustomization is another area where StreamEye excels. The platform provides users with the ability to create custom templates and workflows tailored to their specific needs. Whether it\\'s designing a unique layout for social media posts or setting up a workflow for video production, StreamEye ensures that every asset produced aligns perfectly with brand guidelines.\\n\\nThis level of customization not only enhances consistency but also allows brands to adapt quickly to changing market demands. By having control over templates and workflows, teams can iterate rapidly on new offers and campaigns without compromising on quality. This aligns with StreamEye\\'s unique proposition of \"Own Your Brand.\"\\n\\n### Collaboration Benefits\\n\\nEffective collaboration is crucial for any successful marketing team. StreamEye facilitates seamless teamwork by allowing multiple stakeholders to review and approve content in real-time. This feature reduces the risk of errors and miscommunication, ensuring that everyone is aligned with the brand\\'s vision [3].\\n\\nFor example, a marketing team can collaborate on a video project where different members handle scriptwriting, design, and editing. StreamEye\\'s collaborative platform ensures that all changes are tracked, feedback is incorporated efficiently, and the final product meets high-quality standards. This adaptability reflects StreamEye\\'s commitment to being a \"Platform That Follows You.\"\\n\\n## A Real-World Success Story: LiveScore\\n\\nTo illustrate how StreamEye makes a difference, let\\'s look at the case of LiveScore, a leading sports media company. LiveScore uses StreamEye to produce high-volume, high-quality digital assets for their global audience.

Notably, LiveScore reported a 30% increase in content output and a 25% reduction in production time after implementing StreamEye. Their success story highlights how StreamEye can transform an organization\\'s digital asset production capabilities.\\n\\n## Ensuring Quality Control\\n\\nMaintaining quality is paramount in any digital asset production process. StreamEye addresses this through its Approvals feature, which enforces teams to publish only approved content by a designated party within the organization. This ensures that all assets meet the required standards before publication, particularly crucial for regulated markets [3].\\n\\nBy integrating quality control into the workflow, StreamEye helps brands maintain their reputation and deliver consistent experiences to their audience. This feature is especially beneficial for industries where compliance is critical, ensuring that all marketing materials adhere to necessary regulations.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Elevate Your Digital Asset Production\\n\\nIn conclusion, mass-producing digital assets at scale is no longer a challenge but an opportunity for enterprise brands.
