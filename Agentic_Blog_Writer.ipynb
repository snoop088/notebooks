It's great to help you with this topic.\\n\\nFrom the context, I can see that lack of time and high costs are two essential pain points when it comes to creativity for betting companies [1]. This suggests that they may struggle to produce ads efficiently and effectively within their existing resources.\\n\\nIn terms of common challenges, one potential issue is the outsourcing team having inadequate knowledge of the company and its products, projects, ideas, and vision [2]. This could lead to misaligned ad production efforts or a lack of understanding of the target audience's needs.\\n\\nRegarding the typical workflow for betting companies, it seems that they may face difficulties in scaling ad production across channels and optimizing programmatic efforts [3]. This implies that their current processes might not be agile enough to keep up with changing market conditions or customer preferences.\\n\\nAs for whether they have in-house teams handling everything from concept to delivery, the context doesn't provide a clear answer. However, it's likely that many betting companies outsource certain aspects of the ad production process to specialized agencies or vendors.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] https://www.bannerflow.com/resources/ultimate-guides/in-house-marketing\\n[2] https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-greatest-pain-point-with-outsourcing-software-development\\n[3] https://www.bannerflow.com/resources/ultimate-guides/in-house-marketing\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'llama3.1:8b-instruct-fp16', 'created_at': '2025-02-12T10:04:02.276059323Z', 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ''}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 7677875814, 'load_duration': 25994711, 'prompt_eval_count': 632, 'prompt_eval_duration': 175000000, 'eval_count': 278, 'eval_duration': 7470000000}, name='expert', id='run-b803d3e7-14f9-4d6f-96b8-974d5105fbb7-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 632, 'output_tokens': 278, 'total_tokens': 910}),\n",

The goal is to present Streameye as an omni-channel digital asset production powerhouse. Let me start by understanding all the pieces provided.\\n\\nFirst, there's a detailed plan for the blog post which includes sections like introduction, shift towards omni-channel, advancements in technology, measuring success, role of technology, Streameye's value proposition, benefits, case studies, and conclusion. I should make sure to follow this structure closely but also be flexible if needed.\\n\\nLooking at the interview with the marketing expert, it highlights that consumer behavior is a big driver for omni-channel strategies. The expert mentions stats about increased sales and customer retention when using omni-channel methods. Also, they discuss key metrics like ROAS and conversion rates. I should incorporate these points into the article to emphasize their importance.\\n\\nThe knowledge base includes documents with statistics on omnichannel effectiveness, such as a 287% increase in sales. These stats are crucial for backing up claims about why omni-channel is essential. Additionally, there's information on AI and cloud solutions driving growth, which ties into how technology enables Streameye's platform.\\n\\nThe previous blog posts give examples of formatting and structure. They use clear headings, bullet points, and integrate real-life examples or case studies. I should aim for a similar style to maintain consistency.\\n\\nNow, thinking about the content flow: Start with an introduction explaining what omni-channel is and why it matters. Then discuss the shift in consumer behavior pushing brands towards omni-channel. Next, delve into how technology like AI and cloud storage makes this feasible. After that, outline the key metrics brands should track. Then explain Streameye's role in this ecosystem, highlighting their unique features. Include benefits and maybe some case studies if available. Finally, conclude by summarizing the importance of omni-channel and how Streameye can help.\\n\\nI need to ensure all sources are cited properly within the article. For example, when mentioning the 287% sales increase, I should link back to the provided source. Also, avoid any mention of the interview since it's internal.\\n\\nPotential pain points for readers might include tracking too many metrics or feeling overwhelmed by technology. Addressing these by explaining how Streameye simplifies processes and provides tools to manage digital assets efficiently could be beneficial.\\n\\nI should also make sure the article is engaging, maybe start with a surprising stat or a relatable scenario about consumer expectations today. Using subheadings and bullet points will help with readability, as seen in previous articles.\\n\\nFinally, I'll need to write this in markdown format, keeping paragraphs concise and using appropriate headers. Make sure the language is professional yet approachable, avoiding jargon where possible.\\n</think>\\n\\n# The Future of Marketing: Why Omni-Channel Digital Asset Production is No Longer a Nice-to-Have, But a Must-Have\\n\\nIn today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses are constantly seeking ways to stay ahead of the curve.

As a marketer, it's imperative to stay up-to-date with the latest trends to ensure that your ads are effective and engaging. This article highlights the most important guidelines that will shape the next phase of effective advertising.\\n\\nBefore jumping in, make sure to check out our portfolio of [successful HTML5 ad campaigns](/showcase).\\n  \\n\\n## Digital Advertising: Top 6 trends\\n \\n\\n1.  ### Humour/ Make your audience smile\\n Who doesn't love a little bit of humour added to a quality product advertisement? If your ad can make people smile and associate positively with your brand, you're already halfway to winning their hearts. Fun ads do require a bit more creativity, but the payoff is worth it. After all, consumers are already feeling fatigued from the constant negativity that has flooded the online space in recent years. Witty humour can be a powerful tool to create engagement and reach, making your brand more relatable and memorable in the process.\\n\\n  \\n\\nA good example of a humorous ad with positive vibes is [Lidl’s campaign](/showcase/LIDL-Summer-20) created with our Creative Management Platform. The happy coconut is casually swimming in the ocean of high-quality products at reasonable prices inviting the clients to dive in too.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n2.  ### Generic/ One ad, wider audience\\n    \\n\\nAs data privacy concerns continue to rise, marketers may need to get a little more creative with their ad strategies. Instead of hyper-targeted ads, the trend is shifting towards more generic yet engaging ads that can appeal to a wider audience. So, it's not about making bland ads but creating ads that can resonate with a larger group of people.\\n\\n  \\n\\nOne example of a brand with generic banner ads is Coca-Cola. They often use simple and generic designs with their iconic red and white colours and their logo prominently displayed. These ads are not targeting any specific audience but rather casting a wide net to appeal to a broad range of consumers. The focus of their ads is often on their brand message of happiness and refreshment, rather than a specific product or service.\\n\\n  \\n\\n3.  ### Retro/ Flashback to the old days\\n    \\n\\nThe nostalgia trend continues in 2023, and we expect brands to use retro elements in their ad designs. Bright colors, textured backgrounds, simple designs, and expressive fonts are just a few ways to bring a nostalgic feel to your ad. Just check out the [examples here](https://www.designstack.co/2014/08/retro-vintage-ads-for-social-media.html) for inspiration. Did you go back in time? Because we definitely did!\\n\\n  \\n\\n4.  ### Nature/ Eco-friendly ad design\\n    \\n\\nAs consumers become more environmentally conscious, brands must adapt their advertising strategies. Brands that frame themselves as eco-friendly using blues and earth tones can definitely appeal to this growing market.\\n\\n  \\n\\nPatagonia sets a remarkable example of integrating eco-friendly ad design into its advertising strategy. Their ads showcase breathtaking landscapes, while their commitment to using recycled and sustainable materials in their products has helped establish them as leaders in eco-friendly fashion and outdoor gear.\\n\\n  \\n\\n5.  ### Effectiveness/ Ad scoring\\n    \\n\\nAd scoring is a trend that's gaining traction in the advertising industry, especially as companies face budget cuts and want to ensure that their ad campaigns are successful. Ad scoring involves evaluating various qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the potential performance of an ad before it's published. For instance, a company may use ad scoring to assess the effectiveness of a particular ad concept based on factors such as the target audience, the ad's messaging, the call-to-action, the creative elements, and the overall impact on brand awareness and sales. By using ad scoring, companies can make data-driven decisions about their ad campaigns and optimize their marketing strategies for better results.\\n\\n  \\n\\nA real-life example of ad scoring is the recent campaign by Amazon for their Alexa product. The company created multiple ads and tested them across multiple platforms, analyzing which ones resonated with the target audience the most. By using ad scoring, Amazon created ads that delivered better results and increased sales.\\n\\n  \\n\\nIf you need help with creating and testing multiple designs for your next campaign but also want to save time and resources, see how [Streameye’s Creative Management Platform](/features) can give you a push.\\n\\n  \\n\\n6.  ### AI-generated art\\n    \\n\\nAI-generated art is becoming increasingly popular in the creative industry, and more businesses are expected to incorporate it into their workflows in 2023. This technology allows for efficient design processes, and even those without formal design skills can create visually stunning artwork with the help of algorithms. AI-generated art can come in various forms such as images, videos, and music, and it uses complex mathematical computations and machine learning to analyze and replicate patterns in existing artwork. It has the potential to revolutionize the creative industry and make design more accessible to everyone. Here are a few examples of how [AI can be used in marketing and advertising](https://blog.socialmediastrategiessummit.com/10-examples-of-ai-in-marketing/).\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\nDo you agree with these trends?

In it, more than 2 100 marketers shared their outlook on how they use social media to grow and promote their brands. The results of the study shed light on various topics, including:\\n  \\n\\n-   The advantages of Social media marketing: how social media helps achieve digital marketing goals and how the years of expertise give the upper hand\\n    \\n-   These are the platforms that not only promise but deliver the best exposure, leads, traffic, sales, and client loyalty.\\n    \\n-   Marketers’ favourite social media platforms: how they have been using them so far and their strategic plans for the future\\n    \\n-   Organic reach: how marketers leverage organic activities\\n    \\n-   Video marketing: where videos reach a wider audience and sell more\\n    \\n-   Social Media paid advertising: marketers’ most used platforms\\n    \\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## A Quick Overview of the Study’s Findings\\n\\n  \\n\\nFacebook continues to lose its position as the social media giant. Since 2018, marketers have been slowly but steadily switching to other platforms. Since then, their interest in Facebook as a favourite way to connect to clients has declined from 67% to 45%. Only 37% of marketers who took part in the study stated their plans to increase organic activities on Facebook.\\n\\n  \\n\\nDespite this, Facebook's dominance remains strong. An overwhelming 89% of marketers utilize Facebook, with Instagram following closely at 80%. For 45% of marketers, Facebook ranks as their most crucial social platform. Additionally, 67% of them employ Facebook ads, and nearly half (45%) consider the Facebook platform the most pivotal for their advertising efforts. Moreover, Facebook stands out for driving the highest traffic and making the most significant contribution to sales.\\n\\n  \\n\\nYouTube is gaining power. Almost 70% of digital marketers expressed their interest in learning more about organic video reach on the platform and about 60% of them plan on increasing their usage of YouTube video.\\n\\n  \\n\\nInstagram remains a highly favoured social media platform, maintaining its status as one of the top choices among marketers. Alongside YouTube, it continues to attract considerable attention and curiosity in the marketing realm, with 56% of marketers planning to increase their Instagram organic activities.\\n\\n  \\n\\nTikTok is also on the rise. The adoption of TikTok among marketers increased from 18% in 2022 to 22% in 2023. A noteworthy 38% have intentions to boost their engagement on the platform and a substantial 48% express interest in gaining more knowledge about TikTok.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## Here is the Deep Dive into the Report\\n\\nThe study begins by addressing key questions and common challenges faced by digital marketers, with a primary focus on enhancing sales and generating leads, a priority for over 50% of marketers. Other significant objectives include increasing brand exposure, cultivating a broad base of loyal followers, and boosting traffic to the brand's official platforms.\\n\\n  \\n\\n## Social Media Presence: Benefits for the business\\n\\n  \\n\\nAround 86% of marketers affirmed that their social media efforts have significantly amplified their business exposure and have increased the traffic to the brand’s platforms by 76%. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that marketers with 2 or more years of social media experience demonstrate better sales results. Most of them attribute their success to platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These are also the two leading platforms that they count on to develop a loyal fanbase.\\n\\n  \\n\\nWhen it comes to generating leads, things look a bit different. Here leading platforms are Facebook and LinkedIn.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## Preference of Social Media Platforms: B2C & B2B\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe most commonly used platforms remain Facebook and Instagram, with TikTok notably gaining power, with growth from 18% in 2022 to 22% in 2023.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe most favourite channels for B2C marketers are Facebook and Instagram, followed by Linkedin, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok.\\n\\n  \\n\\nOn the other hand, the most preferred channel for B2B marketers is LinkedIn, closely followed by Facebook Instagram, and the rest of the social media platforms. B2B marketers’ interest in Facebook and Instagram dropped from 51% in 2022 to 43% in 2023.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## What About Organic Reach Strategies?\\n\\n  \\n\\nAbout 14% of marketers have indicated their decreased interest in Facebook when it comes to organic reach activities, while a significant 37% have stated the opposite - they will be still counting on Facebook as the most important platform for user engagement. 43% of them are not going to take active measures to change their digital strategies.\\n\\n  \\n\\nIn the meantime, 56% of marketers are turning to Instagram to boost their organic reach. 59% of B2C marketers express plans to increase their Instagram presence, compared to 52% of B2B.\\n\\n  \\n\\nFor YouTube, around 63% of marketers will work on increasing organic reach. For LinkedIn, the number is 55%, for TikTok - 38%, and for Twitter - 16%.\\n\\n  \\n\\nMarketers were asked about the social media platforms they are eager to gain more knowledge about. Instagram maintained its top position for the fifth consecutive year, while Facebook slipped to the fourth spot, trailing behind LinkedIn.\\n\\n  \\n\\nNotably, B2C marketers exhibit greater interest in learning about Instagram and Facebook compared to their B2B colleagues. Meanwhile, B2B marketers display a significantly higher interest in acquiring insights about LinkedIn.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n## Which Social Media Platform is Favourite for Video?\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe study indicates that marketers are planning to turn to video marketing. They show the most interest in Instagram videos (66%), YouTube videos (66%), and Facebook videos (53%). As YouTube and Instagram topped the list of video platforms, interest in Facebook has dropped from 63% in 2022 to 57% in 2023.\\n\\n  \\n\\nAgain, there is a slight difference between B2B and B2C. B2C marketers are more open to diving into Instagram videos (72% B2C vs. 59% B2B) and Facebook videos (62% B2C vs. 49% B2B). On the flip side, B2B marketers show a stronger interest in understanding LinkedIn videos (65% B2B vs. 44% B2C).\\n\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n## What About Paid Advertising?\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe ad platform most used by marketers for paid advertising is Facebook (67%), followed by Instagram (52%). B2C marketers are more likely to use Facebook ads (71% B2C vs. 61% B2B) while B2B marketers are prone to using LinkedIn ads (39% B2B vs. 17% B2C).\\n\\n  \\n\\nEven though most marketers pointed out Facebook as their preferred platform for paid ads, the usage percentage has dropped from 51% in 2022 to 46% in 2023. Interestingly, the overall interest in paid social ads has increased from 22% to 25%.\\n\\n  \\n\\nWhen marketers had to identify the platform they wanted to get more insights about, Instagram took first place with 60%. B2C marketers showed consistent interest in Facebook and Instagram, while their B2B counterparts kept their focus on LinkedIn.\\n\\n  \\n\\nWe hope you found these findings as interesting and insightful as we did!

While the banner creation process may seem straightforward, manually creating them at scale is an extremely involved process.\\n\\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the intricate details of banner creation, it can be impossible to choose the right software for your team.From concepts to design to copy, we’ve broken down the most important elements for choosing the best banner software.\\n\\nWhat’s involved in creating ad banners?\\nMany software products promise to empower your marketers and designers, but if you’re a CMO or marketing manager, you might not be familiar with all of the details that go into banner creation.\\n\\nMarketing teams develop concepts and copy, followed by designers who create dozens of different variations (both in terms of content and dimensions). It’s crucial that teams keep a close eye on file sizes to ensure that their banners are not only accepted by publishing platforms but also load quicker than the competition.\\n\\n## What StreamEye offers digital businesses\\n\\nThe right software – like StreamEye – is proven to [save dozens of working hours every month](/blog/What_If_Your_Team_Members_Had_Extra_5_Hours) while empowering your marketing and design teams.\\n\\n## Scalability\\n\\nHow many banners do you need to create and what does scaling look like for your company? When your business environment changes and you need to react quickly with new ads to take advantage, understanding your precise scaling needs will make an enormous difference.\\n\\nThe best banner software automates as much of this process as possible, allowing teams to produce large numbers of custom banners with minimal delay for development and coordination. Specifically, you’ll want to choose software that automatically generates differently-sized banners and unique banner content – both of which we’ll explore in greater detail below.\\n\\n## Quickly & easily change content in multiple banner sizes\\n\\nThere’s nothing particularly complex about it, but it’s one of the most overlooked aspects of banner creation: You design a banner and then need it sized for use across multiple platforms and media types.\\n\\nThe reality? It quickly turns into a burdensome exercise. For example, you may have 10 different content variations and require 10 different sizes for each. You’re asking designers to manually create 100 unique banners. The required time drive up costs and leave your company unable to meet the demand for other new campaigns.\\n\\nInstead of days (or even weeks), the right banner software can create those 100 unique banners within minutes.\\n\\n## Easy to access libraries\\n\\nIn addition to a wide variety of banners, your company might struggle to manage the dozens of images, videos, and other media in your library of content. Having a strong user interface to navigate, organise, and use this content makes an enormous difference in the day-to-day running of campaigns.\\n\\nEven for simpler operations that don’t require much media, [testing different banners](https://www.niche.com/about/enrollment-insights/a-guide-to-digital-marketing-experimentation-and-optimization-in-education/) for different purposes should be carried out regularly. In other words, you’ll see better ROI by testing different permutations of each banner until you find the best performers. As a nice side bonus, you’ll discover what kind of messaging resonates with your audience(s) most.\\n\\n## Instant updates\\n\\nYou want to be able to push new content and offers at the drop of a hat, and manually updating banner content is simply a waste of your marketing team’s time.

That's why many enterprise brands are turning to animated skins, HTML 5 banners that can be placed on websites with a dedicated space for them. These animated skins can be easily created and positioned on various websites, offering a unique and eye-catching way to reach target audiences.\\n\\nAnimated skins are increasingly being used by advertisers to make their online campaigns more visually appealing and interactive. These skins are essentially background wallpapers that can be used to display ads without interfering with the site’s original content.\\n\\nWhile [takeover skins](/blog/Takeover_Skins_And_Responsive_Banners) have been around for years, they have recently gained attention due to their effectiveness. In fact, many advertisers are turning to takeover skins to make their ads more engaging and memorable.\\n\\n\\n## Isn’t that just a takeover skin?\\n\\nTakeover skins are generally static, but it is possible to create dynamic ones with tools like StreamEye. They are generally created to take advantage of full HD resolution (1920x1080) and are designed to fit the dimensions of the site’s content. However, takeover skins are generally aimed at desktop users because there just isn’t a good way to display content on the margins for a tall and narrow phone screen.\\n\\nResponsive banners, on the other hand, are a newer format that is quickly gaining popularity. Unlike takeover skins, responsive banners are able to automatically adjust to the size of the screen on which they’re viewed. They can function on mobile screens as well as desktops and tablets. However, this does put some limits on the use of animations within the ad because those animations need to work no matter the screen size.\\n\\nOnce you combine the takeover skin placeholder with the responsive banner functions, there comes her majesty, the animated skin, which we are discussing in today’s post.\\n  \\n\\n## The Power of Animated Skins\\n\\nAnimated skins offer a powerful way for brands to make their ads stand out from the competition. With dynamic elements that catch the eye and increase engagement, animated skins can help brands achieve higher retention rates and better ROI. They also offer a way for brands to create campaigns that are more memorable, as they leave a lasting impression on viewers.\\n \\n\\n## The Benefits of Using Animated Skins in Big Ad Campaigns\\n\\nOne of the biggest benefits of animated skins is that animated skins are simply more visually appealing than traditional banner ads. With their dynamic elements and eye-catching designs, animated skins can grab the attention of viewers and encourage them to engage with the ad.\\n\\nAnd while animated skins may be more expensive than traditional HTML5 banners, their effectiveness in engaging audiences makes them a worthwhile investment for bigger campaigns or more specialized ad campaigns.\\n\\nAnother benefit of animated skins is that they offer API integration, which allows viewers to interact with the ad in different ways. For example, viewers can click on elements within the ad to change its behavior or to trigger different events as well as receive up-to-date information about the product offering. This level of interactivity offers a brilliant new way for brands to engage with their target audiences and create more personalized experiences.\\n\\nFinally, animated skins are fully responsive, meaning they can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This makes them ideal for campaigns that need to reach audiences across different devices and platforms.\\n\\nIf you are aware of all the benefits of such a powerful tool like the animated skins but don’t know how to streamline the creative process for your brand, it is highly probable that you are [ready to implement a CMP](/blog/does_your_business_need_a_cmp_now) as part of your marketing efforts.

And you may be thinking that this sounds great but do you still find it difficult to imagine how a tool like this can be integrated into your team’s daily efforts?\\n\\nBefore diving in, maybe you would like to read our [creative management platform fundamentals piece](/blog/Creative_Management_Platform_When_You_Need_One) first.\\n\\n## How a creative management tool maximizes the efficiency in banner creation for successful brands?\\n\\nAnd so what do creative management tools do to actually help us, marketers? Here’s a list of the most important aspects of working with a CMP in 2023:\\n\\n### It saves time\\n\\nCMP tools help brands go to market in a matter of minutes. They help automate ad production by integrating dynamic data into the ads and updating the display ads quickly and easily. They can produce engaging HTML5 animated ads with the brand’s latest promotions, thus helping their fast communication. And all of this, essentially, saves time.\\n\\n### It saves money\\n\\nUsing a CMP could often help decrease production costs and increase ROI. It is a tool that has the potential to make your marketing self-provisioned when deploying new offers live. And isn’t it an essential part of our job to acquire more leads at a cheaper cost? We bet there is not a single one of you here who doesn’t want better efficiency. Creative management tools can help us achieve it easily.\\n\\n### It frees up resources\\n\\nSacrificing a big part of your best designers’ time to repetitive and tedious tasks is always something good managers try to avoid. CMPs’ automation and creative possibilities free up your team’s time for tasks that are more strategic, creative and inspirational. Let your designer team (be it internal or outsourced) do what they are good at - creating new concepts, working on inspiring projects and exploring their creativity. Let the CMP free up their time for the good stuff.\\n\\n### It helps you create asset galleries with easy access\\n\\nGood CMPs create for your brand a resource bank that can be easily reused across digital ads. You can feed and update the asset bank with relevant imagery at your convenience. The platform provides you with everything ready all in one place with a click of a distance. Best creative management platform providers also offer the feature to connect galleries to APIs to automate image selection in ads. And that is really powerful.\\n\\n### It can help you gain full creative production autonomy\\n\\nIf you feel like you want to make creative work more flexible and agile, you may benefit from a tool that requires less effort from your team. In-housing your creative production is not just more cost-effective – it allows you to become more responsive to market changes and your competitors' actions. With Streameye, you can tweak creatives, update messaging, and change your offers in a matter of minutes, without the help of a developer or even a senior designer. Your custom templates and vast visual library mean you can push that offer out when you see fit – and not a minute later.\\n\\n### It streamlines and optimizes the production processes\\n\\nGood creative management platforms multiply the creative production quickly and effortlessly. Configuring the CMP according to your company’s flows and processes, brands often find a lot of room for improvement. It’s not rare that they get inspired by the platform’s features to optimize their own production process and recreate it to serve them better. With Streameye, you get expert advice and support that will elevate your creative abilities even further. Streameye doesn't just bring you creative templates fit for your brand. Our team will be there to help you get the most out of the platform from the start and stay up to date with the latest digital creative technology. We'll proactively bring you ideas to improve your demand generation results and make use of new creative opportunities. And as much as it’s good if the creative management tool can work according to your internal process flows, it can also be of great help in optimizing it and making it work even better for the company.\\n\\n### It expands the creative resources and marketing assets\\n\\nUsing a CMP can easily empower your marketing team to use formats that usually take more time and effort to create in-house. An example of that could be creating [video ads](/blog/Power_Of_Video_Ads) without blocking any motion team resources for the purpose. Another example could be using [takeover skins or responsive banners](/blog/Takeover_Skins_And_Responsive_Banners) that the team hasn’t prioritized testing out.\\n\\nHaving a professional CMP partner in your company can help get an edge over your competitors with always relevant content. Additionally, it inspires with templates and/or seasonal campaign ideas that you can consider, plan and execute within the blink of an eye.\\n\\n## Do CMPs help in keeping full control over brand consistency?\\n\\nThey are and they’d better.\\n\\nOne characteristic feature of all good creative management platforms is the ability to ensure brand consistency and approved on-brand-only resource use.\\n\\nChoosing a good CMP will also help you get full control over your digital campaigns and create ads that always feel and look like you.\\n\\nAt Streameye, for example, your pre-approved creative templates will consistently maintain your brand style for you. You can lock different creative elements to ensure they stay put across all ads. By doing that, you make sure certain aspects of the branding remain always the same and you simply stop worrying about them.\\n\\nTrusting a CMP tool will oftentimes help you skip the tedious approval back-and-forth with custom creative templates and pre-approved assets that fit your brand. With a good CMP by your side, you are to keep full control of how elements can be changed and eliminate any inconsistencies across your ads. Your team will be able to design dynamic creatives with high impact and you will keep your peace of mind knowing all brand guidelines and industry requirements are kept in check.\\n\\n## Can we use creative management tools without sacrificing the quality or quantity of produced marketing material?\\n\\nNot only!\\n\\nHaving creative management software in your toolset, you will be able to multiply your creative work into different formats and sizes in a matter of seconds. You will be able to dynamically change campaign details within a click of a time.\\n\\nYou will also have access to a lot of templates and other forms of inspiration (e.g. seasonal campaigns). You will be saving both time and effort and you will be doing that without wondering if the creative output will turn out right as it should.\\n\\nYou will be empowered to widen the spectrum of marketing formats your team is regularly using without needing to invest in training, equipment, etc. The best creative management tools will give you options you are hardly able to use without greater investments. Test these out and get the most out of them for your company.

All you need is for them to work together to grow your business.\\n\\n_But it’s never that simple._\\n\\nEffective collaboration requires more than just talent: Your marketing and design teams need the right attitude, systems and tools to be effective. Below, we break down the three key areas where you can make an impact to get better results for your business – and how StreamEye makes that possible.\\n\\n## 1. Minimising handoffs\\n\\nNo one likes handoffs, but when your marketing involves creating visuals like banner ads at scale, it seems inevitable. Once you start talking about multiple ads in seemingly endless sizes, various languages and changing offers, there’s an immense amount of back and forth between marketing and design teams.\\n\\nThe key is to use a tool like StreamEye which empowers marketers to take a single design and modify it independently. When the design team only needs to create a single base design (which the marketers can then use to their heart’s content), back and forth between teams is greatly reduced.\\n\\n## 2. Accountability\\n\\nSpeaking of empowering marketing teams, placing more capabilities in their hands is critical for greater accountability. Consider when a mistake ends up in a final ad: who gets the blame? Is it the marketer (who didn’t effectively communicate what had to happen) or the designer (who didn’t ask themselves “is this what marketing wants?”)?\\n\\nIn a world with plenty of handoffs, it’s also easy to pass off the blame when something goes wrong. Giving marketing teams more capabilities to independently create and modify ads means greater accountability. Ultimately, [teams that are accountable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentgleeson/2016/12/08/why-accountability-is-critical-for-achieving-winning-results/) are teams that perform better.\\n\\nStreamEye prevents the “it’s not my fault” conversation by giving marketing teams tools to operate more independently with existing designs.\\n\\n## 3. Meaningful work from both ends\\n\\nImagine you’re a designer and are told to take a basic design and create 120 versions of it in 4 languages, 10 designs, and 4 offers.\\n\\nDesigners don’t want to spend their days doing menial tasks like generating dozens of slightly different versions of the same image. Worse, it hurts their productivity.\\n\\nIf your designers are spending their time developing more impactful designs, they’re going to enjoy their work better and produce better results. Better still, when your designers only need to focus on their main work, you’ll need fewer working hours from them.\\n\\nStreamEye automates work that once took hours, ensuring that your marketing and design teams can be more focused on impactful work.\\n\\n## 4. Responsiveness\\n\\nWhen you’re in a fast-changing industry, your marketing team may occasionally need to make critical adjustments to their ads ASAP. Being held up by waiting on designers to make updates is a poor recipe for good collaboration.\\n\\nAvoid wasting golden opportunities (and the need to involve designers) during these critical moments. It is StreamEye's core mission to make your marketers more effective and give your designers a break from playing robots.\\n\\n## StreamEye streamlines marketing and design work\\n\\nThe right tool makes team collaboration far easier, and that’s why StreamEye was created: to make productive collaboration seamless.

This phenomenon has a name and it is retargeting, also referred to as remarketing. It is nothing fancy, just sound technology at play.\\n\\n  \\n\\nRetargeting is a technique in the action arsenal of every experienced digital marketer. It is a marketing strategy that allows businesses to retarget and show relevant ads to users that have previously clicked on their ad or have visited the business’s website without completing a desired action, most often a purchase.\\n\\n  \\n\\nIt is all possible thanks to the so-called cookies that help with tracking users’ behaviour on the business’s website and then allow for the delivery of targeted ads while they browse other sites or social media platforms.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe sole purpose of retargeting is to get back in front of people and remind them that they have been interested in the business’s products or services. This increases the likelihood that these people will return to the website and complete a purchase, converting them into customers.\\n\\n  \\n\\nRetargeting is a powerful tool that requires a smart and creative approach. The reason is that every user exhibits different behaviour, visits different pages, and is interested in different products depending on their needs or current mood. Not all undecided users will respond and will be persuaded by the same message. For example, you run a discount on winter clothing. One user checks out a pair of leather boots and directly leaves the website, while another adds a winter coat to his cart, but does not finish the purchase. You will need to come up with at least two unique ads.\\n\\n  \\n\\nThis is why every retargeting campaign has to be carefully premeditated and crafted with the right message and design. A good [creative management platform](/features) gives you an advantage in creating banner ads for your retargeting campaigns because it gives you the flexibility to create as many visuals as you need at reduced cost and optimized time. Check out our [portfolio](/showcase) to get an idea of what designs your marketing team can create.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\n# How does retargeting help your business?\\n\\n  \\n\\n[Research](https://www.gosquared.com/blog/retargeting-visitors#:~:text=For%20most%20websites%2C%20only%202,have%20visited%20your%20website%20before.) suggests that only 2% of visitors make a purchase the first time they visit your website. Don’t let the growth of your business to chance. Get the attention of the rest 98% and remind them of the benefits of your products or services.\\n\\n  \\n\\n-   ### Increase your conversion rates\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\nRetargeting can help businesses boost their conversion rates by retargeting the right people with the right message. Selling your products and services to someone who is already familiar with them and has shown interest is much easier than turning a completely new audience into paying customers.\\n\\n  \\n\\n-   ### Boost brand awareness\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\nRetargeting can also be used to build brand awareness and familiarity. This will make your brand more recognizable than the competition and will close the gap between you and the consumers. Don’t forget that people prefer to use the products and services of brands that they know and trust.\\n\\n  \\n\\n-   ### Create upselling and cross-selling opportunities\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\nRetargeting can also be used to promote related products or services to people who have already made a purchase. Often, customers access your site with a specific idea in mind but don’t realize that an additional accessory can be very useful. For example, someone just bought a new phone from you but forgot to get a screen protector, a phone case, or a selfie stick. By showing them ads for complementary products, businesses can increase their revenue and customer lifetime value.\\n\\n  \\n\\n-   ### Get people to return to their abandoned carts\\n    \\n\\n  \\n\\nStudies show that about 2/3 of shoppers leave the site without finishing their purchase. Retargeting gives you the potential to win those people back and turn them into buying customers. If you feel like it, you could even offer them a coupon discount or a gift if they complete their purchase within 24h.\\n\\n  \\n\\nLaunching effective display retargeting campaigns is crucial for the success of every business.

It’s become a [ubiquitous tool](https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-platforms/video-marketing/video-marketing-statistics-to-know/) because of its persuasiveness and ability to hold viewer interest. At StreamEye, we’ve been determining precisely how to assist our users in exporting their video file formats to banners.\\n\\nAfter countless tests, we’ve finally unlocked a new way for you to advertise and communicate with your audiences. Let’s look into what this new functionality looks like, why it’s so powerful and what you can do with it.\\n\\n## Why video banners are a game changer\\n\\nFrom social networks to ecommerce platforms, consumers have come to expect video content. Ads like static banners just don’t perform the way they used to. In fact, one study by Tubular Insights found a [400-700% increase in CTR](https://tubularinsights.com/video-ads-more-effective/). Considering the inputs needed (more on that later), this can translate into an incredible boost in ROI for your advertising.\\n\\nSo while video has opened up a world of possibilities for advertisers on platforms like Youtube, video in social network advertising has been limited. This is because these networks don’t accept HTML5 banners with video embedded.\\n\\n### Bringing the power of video to more platforms and channels\\n\\nExporting video file formats from StreamEye was a natural way to provide our clients with a more powerful omni-channel marketing production platform. This will enable StreamEye users to do more to boost efficiency, simplify training and explore new ways to market your products and services.\\n\\n### How we’ve brought video to StreamEye users\\n\\nSo how do you create video banners within StreamEye? We’ve worked hard to ensure you can use the same familiar asset structure for static or HTML5 banners. This means you can select – or even mix and match – different offers within the same ad by using your searchable galleries.\\n\\nAlthough video is undoubtedly more complex, StreamEye’s ease-of-use is still there. Our incorporation of AWS makes creating video ads at scale simple and intuitive.\\n\\nYou don’t have to sacrifice functionality to start working with video banners: Our powerful text formatting and fitting capabilities apply just as much to video.\\n\\nLastly, not all video is created equal, but you’ll never have to sacrifice quality or flexibility when producing yours. Video sources and audio clips can be seamlessly integrated in our platform to produce highly-engaging animated video ads. The only thing holding you back is your imagination.\\n\\n### What you can expect from bringing video to your banners\\n\\nAlongside our HTML5 ads and static ads for email and social networks, our video banner options open up new possibilities for your online advertising. If you’re already a StreamEye Professional client, the video module is a free ad-on and there aren’t any new systems to learn.\\n\\nIf you’re new to StreamEye, you’ll discover that our system for building and running stronger banner ads at scale is easy to learn and surprisingly powerful.\\n\\nWhat are you waiting for?

For decades, the federal government prohibited the practice and therefore it was only legal in a few states. In 2018, however, the US Supreme Court reversed this ban, paving the way for individual states to legalize sportsbooks.\\n\\nAs of 2022, more than half of the country has already initiated the process of legalizing sports betting.\\n\\nMany regulated states limit in-game advertising to just advertising for casinos and prohibit advertisements during televised sporting events until after 9 p.m., depending on the type of game being aired (or earlier). Some states require websites to obtain a license before operating within their jurisdiction; others rely on federal regulations instead.\\n\\n## What changed in 2018?\\n\\nIn 2018, the US Supreme Court reversed the federal ban on sports betting, thus allowing individual states to legalize sportsbooks.\\n\\nOn May 14, 2018, the US Supreme Court ruled that individual states may decide whether or not to legalize sports betting. The ruling overturned a 1992 federal law that banned sports betting except in four states.\\n\\nThis decision opened the door for states to regulate sports betting themselves and could be considered a major win for those who want to see legal sportsbooks opened across the country.\\n\\n## What happened next?\\n\\nIn 2019, 10 states had legalized sports betting and another 13 had their legislation pending.\\n\\nThe first states to legalize sports betting were New Jersey, Mississippi and West Virginia and the ones coming right after included Pennsylvania, Texas, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Rhode Island. In addition to the above states, Puerto Rico had also passed legislation that would allow for regulated online gaming.\\n\\n## How about now?\\n\\nAs of November 2022, sports betting in the US has expanded to over 30 states and counting. A state-by-state breakdown is available for information in [this CBS Sports article.](https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/u-s-sports-betting-heres-where-all-50-states-stand-on-legalizing-sports-gambling-latest-mobile-bets/) If you are curious about legal details, [Legal Sports Report has tracked](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/sportsbetting-bill-tracker/) quite thoroughly the bills on file and the new laws on the books.\\n\\nSeveral states have turned to online and now allow remote registration. This means anyone can sign up from their couch and immediately start betting with several of the top online sportsbook options in the country. All of this is possible thanks to these states opening up partnerships between the states' casinos and experienced operators to join up to create a top-notch sports betting product. And of course, that also leads us to advertising.\\n\\n## Advertising limitations\\n\\n### In-game advertising and advertising for casinos\\n\\nMany regulated states limit in-game advertising to just advertising for casinos. There are two main reasons for this:\\n\\n-   Players may be more likely to make impulsive bets when they see a brand or product they like, and\\n    \\n-   Regulators want to protect their states from being overwhelmed with sports betting if it becomes legalized nationwide.\\n    \\n\\n### TV advertising only after 9 p.m. but digital is here to stay\\n\\nIn the United States, several states have legalized different forms of sports betting. For example, New Jersey has legalized both casinos and online gambling.\\n\\nHowever, there is still one major restriction on advertising during televised sporting events: it cannot appear until after 9 p.m., depending on the state and the type of game being aired. This means that you will not be able to see any commercials featuring people placing bets during your favorite televised sporting events such as football or baseball games.\\n\\nThe States still give companies wide latitude over what they can say in advertisements though - quite a different approach compared to the one towards the tobacco industry for example. For the time being, there seem to be no major advertising rules specific to the sports betting industry at the federal level. Having such limited oversight in terms of ad regulation, digital is here to help anyone who knows how to benefit from it.\\n\\n  \\n\\n### License Regime\\n\\nMany states require operators to obtain a license before operating in the state. In some cases, this requirement only applies to operators of sports betting websites; other states have a similar requirement for players as well. Some states also have additional requirements for operators and players depending on what type of game they're playing or where the player is located.\\n\\n## Sports betting rules are specific to each state's jurisdiction\\n\\nThe laws that govern sports betting in the United States are specific to each individual state's jurisdiction. As of right now, there are no federal laws regarding sports betting, so it's up to each state to decide how they want to regulate it. The laws governing sports betting will change from state to state, and it's important for gamblers who live in states where such changes have taken place (or are taking place) to do their research before placing any bets.\\n\\nThe speed at which these laws are changing varies from one area of the country to another - in some places, there have been recent updates within the past few months. In contrast, other states such as Illinois have had virtually no visible movement since the legalization was passed back in 1992.\\n\\nTo conclude, sports betting is already legal in most US states and continues to expand throughout the country. The market is expected to multiply as more states legalize sportsbooks, which will increase consumer demand for advertising, especially on the digital side.\\n\", 'short_copy': 'In 2018, the US Supreme Court reversed the sports betting ban, paving the way for individual states to legalize sportsbooks.

This helps maintain quality control and ensures that all digital assets meet the required standards before they\\'re published.\\n\\nStreameye\\'s API integration also allows users to bring their own data into ads via Streameye API integration, enabling them to create highly personalized and engaging content at scale.\\n\\nSources:\\n[1] https://www.streameye.com/features\\n[2] https://www.streameye.com/case-studies', 'title': 'Scaling Creativity: How Enterprise Brands Can Mass-Produce Digital Assets Without Sacrificing Quality', 'rationale': \"This title highlights Streameye's ability to help enterprise brands produce digital assets at scale, while maintaining quality and control.

However, implementing and using a DAM system can be challenging. In this article, we will discuss common challenges faced by organizations when implementing and using a DAM system, and provide solutions to overcome these challenges.\\n\\n**Common Challenges in DAM**\\n\\n1. **Making the Transition to DAM**: The adoption of a new DAM system can be complex, especially for employees who are accustomed to traditional workflows. To overcome this challenge, it is essential to create an open space for feedback, document historic workflows, and ensure comprehensive training sessions.\\n2. **Asset Discovery and Organization**: Finding digital assets in a DAM system can be difficult if the folder structure is not consistent or well-organized. To solve this challenge, implement a centralized repository with metadata tagging and automated tagging tools.\\n3. **Version Control**: Managing multiple versions of digital assets can lead to errors and inconsistencies. Implementing version control systems that automatically handle updates and revisions can help mitigate this issue.\\n4. **Scalability**: As the volume of digital assets grows, DAM systems may struggle to keep up. To overcome this challenge, choose a cloud-based DAM solution with scalable storage options and flexible subscription plans.\\n5. **User Permissions and Security**: Ensuring that users have access to the right information without compromising security is crucial. Implement role-based access control, use strong encryption protocols, and conduct regular security audits.\\n\\n**Best Practices for Overcoming Common DAM Challenges**\\n\\n1. **Conducting a Needs Assessment**: Before implementing a DAM system, assess your organization\\'s specific needs and goals.\\n2. **Choosing the Right DAM Solution**: Research and evaluate DAM solutions that align with your organization\\'s requirements and stay within budget.\\n3. **Creating a Metadata Strategy**: Develop an organized metadata strategy to categorize content and drive search functionality.\\n4. **Implementing Training Programs**: Provide comprehensive training sessions for users to learn how to use the DAM system effectively.\\n5. **Regular Maintenance and Monitoring**: Regularly audit the DAM system, update software, and monitor performance metrics to ensure efficiency.\\n\\n**Case Studies**\\n\\nOpenAsset has helped various organizations overcome common DAM challenges, including:\\n\\n* CannonDesign, which merged multiple file libraries with OpenAsset\\'s support\\n* Affiliated Engineers, which used OpenAsset\\'s keywording structure to migrate data efficiently\\n* HBW, which built construction presentations with ease after implementing OpenAsset\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nImplementing and using a DAM system can be challenging, but by understanding common challenges and implementing best practices, organizations can overcome these obstacles. By choosing the right DAM solution, creating a metadata strategy, providing comprehensive training, and regularly maintaining the system, organizations can ensure efficient and effective use of their digital assets.\\n\\n**About OpenAsset**\\n\\nOpenAsset is a leading digital asset management platform designed specifically for AEC and real estate professionals.

Read on to know how to win the brand game\"/>\\n            \\n**Understanding Brand Assets: A Comprehensive Guide**\\n\\nIn today\\'s digital age, understanding brand assets is crucial for businesses to differentiate themselves from competitors and build a strong customer loyalty. Brand assets are the visual, audio, or design elements that contribute to how customers recognize and identify a brand. In this article, we will explore what brand assets are, their importance, types, examples, and best practices for managing them.\\n\\n**What are Brand Assets?**\\n\\nBrand assets are a comprehensive compilation of resources that contribute to how customers recognize and identify a brand. These resources can range from simple elements like logos, color palettes, and fonts to more advanced elements like packaging, mottos, and even smells. The key idea is for the customer to uniquely and distinctly recall a specific brand based on these assets.\\n\\n**Why are Brand Assets Important?**\\n\\nBrand assets are essential for businesses because they help create a consistent design and messaging that customers remember. These elements qualify as brand assets only when customers begin to associate them with a brand. By using brand assets effectively, companies can:\\n\\n* Increase customer recognition and awareness\\n* Differentiate themselves from competitors\\n* Build strong customer loyalty\\n* Enhance the effectiveness of marketing campaigns\\n\\n**Types of Brand Assets**\\n\\nBrand assets can be categorized into different types based on their use cases:\\n\\n1. **Social Media Brand Assets**: These include images, reels, videos, hashtags, and other elements used to create a brand\\'s social media presence.\\n2. **Website Brand Assets**: These include logos, typefaces, color schemes, and other elements that define a company\\'s identity on its website.\\n3. **External Use Brand Assets**: These include packaging, sounds, and after-sale experiences that extend the defining touchpoints for a brand.\\n\\n**Examples of Successful Brand Assets**\\n\\nSome examples of successful brand assets include:\\n\\n1. The Nike Swoosh: A simple yet recognizable logo that has become synonymous with athletic wear.\\n2. The Coca-Cola Contour Bottle: A unique shape that has been used in marketing campaigns and has become an iconic symbol of the brand.\\n3. MasterCard\\'s Slogan: A memorable slogan that has been used to promote the brand and differentiate it from competitors.\\n\\n**Best Practices for Brand Asset Management**\\n\\nTo get the most out of brand assets, companies need to adopt best practices for managing them. These include:\\n\\n1. **Targeting and Centralizing**: Identifying and storing brand assets in a centralized location makes it easier to access and manage them.\\n2. **Organizing and Simplifying**: Organizing content using naming conventions, directories, and other tools can make it easier to find and use brand assets.\\n3. **Securing Assets**: Ensuring the digital security of brand assets is crucial to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.\\n4. **Instilling Brand Guidelines**: Establishing clear brand guidelines and SOPs (standard operating procedures) ensures that all stakeholders adhere to the same standards.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nBrand assets are a critical component of any business\\'s marketing strategy. By understanding what brand assets are, their importance, types, examples, and best practices for managing them, companies can differentiate themselves from competitors, build strong customer loyalty, and enhance the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. With the rise of digital technologies like VR and AR, brand asset management systems are becoming increasingly important to ensure that brands stay ahead of the curve.\\n\\n**Recommendations**\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to manage your brand assets and deliver them globally based on the user\\'s device, consider signing up for ImageKit\\'s forever-free plan and giving it a spin.

Whether it\\'s creating multiple versions of images for different social media platforms or generating unique videos for marketing campaigns, the demand for efficient and consistent content creation has never been higher. However, achieving this without compromising on quality can be a daunting task.\\n\\nThis article explores how enterprise brands can overcome these challenges by leveraging advanced tools like StreamEye, which not only streamlines the production process but also ensures that creativity and quality remain at the forefront.\\n\\n## The Challenge of Mass-Producing Digital Assets\\n\\nBefore diving into solutions, it\\'s essential to understand what mass-producing digital assets entails. According to marketing experts, this refers to efficiently creating and distributing a high volume of content in various formats and sizes for different channels and platforms [1]. This can include resizing images for social media or email marketing, as well as producing unique assets like short-form videos for TikTok or Instagram Reels.\\n\\nEnterprise brands often face several pain points when trying to produce digital assets at scale:\\n\\n- **Time-Consuming Manual Processes**: Manually creating and editing each asset is labor-intensive and time-consuming.\\n- **Lack of Resources**: Small teams or limited budgets can hinder the production of high-quality content at the required volume.\\n- **Inconsistent Branding**: Without a centralized system, maintaining brand consistency across all channels becomes challenging [2].\\n- **Difficulty in Scaling Creative Work**: As businesses grow, their creative needs expand, but internal teams may not be equipped to handle increased demand.\\n\\nThese challenges can lead to delayed campaigns, reduced brand consistency, and decreased customer engagement. To address these issues effectively, brands need a robust solution that combines automation, customization, and seamless collaboration.\\n\\n## StreamEye: A Solution for Enterprise Brands\\n\\nStreamEye emerges as a powerful platform designed specifically to meet the needs of enterprise brands looking to scale their digital asset production while maintaining quality. By integrating automation, customization, and collaboration features, StreamEye offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by marketers.\\n\\n### Automation Capabilities\\n\\nOne of the standout features of StreamEye is its automation capabilities. The platform allows users to automate repetitive tasks such as resizing images or generating social media posts. This not only saves time but also frees up creative teams to focus on more strategic and innovative work [3].\\n\\nFor instance, with StreamEye\\'s automation tools, marketers can quickly generate multiple versions of an image for different platforms without manual intervention. This efficiency ensures that content is delivered on time while maintaining high standards.\\n\\n### Customization Options\\n\\nCustomization is another area where StreamEye excels. The platform provides users with the ability to create custom templates and workflows tailored to their specific needs. Whether it\\'s designing a unique layout for social media posts or setting up a workflow for video production, StreamEye ensures that every asset produced aligns perfectly with brand guidelines.\\n\\nThis level of customization not only enhances consistency but also allows brands to adapt quickly to changing market demands. By having control over templates and workflows, teams can iterate rapidly on new offers and campaigns without compromising on quality.\\n\\n### Collaboration Benefits\\n\\nEffective collaboration is crucial for any successful marketing team. StreamEye facilitates seamless teamwork by allowing multiple stakeholders to review and approve content in real-time. This feature reduces the risk of errors and miscommunication, ensuring that everyone is aligned with the brand\\'s vision [3].\\n\\nFor example, a marketing team can collaborate on a video project where different members handle scriptwriting, design, and editing. StreamEye\\'s collaborative platform ensures that all changes are tracked, feedback is incorporated efficiently, and the final product meets high-quality standards.\\n\\n## A Real-World Success Story: LiveScore\\n\\nTo illustrate how StreamEye makes a difference, let\\'s look at the case of LiveScore, a leading sports media company. LiveScore uses StreamEye to produce high-volume, high-quality digital assets for their global audience. With StreamEye, they automate the creation of social media posts, resize images for different channels, and ensure brand consistency across all content [4].\\n\\nThis partnership has enabled LiveScore to streamline their production process, reduce manual errors, and deliver engaging content on time. Their success story highlights how StreamEye can transform an organization\\'s digital asset production capabilities.\\n\\n## Ensuring Quality Control\\n\\nMaintaining quality is paramount in any digital asset production process. StreamEye addresses this through its Approvals feature, which enforces teams to publish only approved content by a designated party within the organization.

       "# Scaling Creativity: How Enterprise Brands Can Mass-Produce Digital Assets Without Sacrificing Quality\n",
       "\n",
       "In today's fast-paced digital landscape, enterprise brands are under constant pressure to produce high-quality digital assets at scale. A staggering 70% of marketers report that creating content is their biggest challenge, highlighting the need for efficient solutions. Whether it's creating multiple versions of images for different social media platforms or generating unique videos for marketing campaigns, the demand for efficient and consistent content creation has never been higher. However, achieving this without compromising on quality can be a daunting task.\n",
       "\n",
       "This article explores how enterprise brands can overcome these challenges by leveraging advanced tools like StreamEye, which not only streamlines the production process but also ensures that creativity and quality remain at the forefront.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Challenge of Mass-Producing Digital Assets\n",
       "\n",
       "Before diving into solutions, it's essential to understand what mass-producing digital assets entails. According to marketing experts, this refers to efficiently creating and distributing a high volume of content in various formats and sizes for different channels and platforms [1]. This can include resizing images for social media or email marketing, as well as producing unique assets like short-form videos for TikTok or Instagram Reels.\n",
       "\n",
       "Enterprise brands often face several pain points when trying to produce digital assets at scale:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Time-Consuming Manual Processes**: Manually creating and editing each asset is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As one industry expert noted, \"The manual process can drain resources and slow down campaigns.\"\n",
       "- **Lack of Resources**: Small teams or limited budgets can hinder the production of high-quality content at the required volume.\n",
       "- **Inconsistent Branding**: Without a centralized system, maintaining brand consistency across all channels becomes challenging [2].\n",
       "- **Difficulty in Scaling Creative Work**: As businesses grow, their creative needs expand, but internal teams may not be equipped to handle increased demand.\n",
       "\n",
       "These challenges can lead to delayed campaigns, reduced brand consistency, and decreased customer engagement. To address these issues effectively, brands need a robust solution that combines automation, customization, and seamless collaboration.\n",
       "\n",
       "## StreamEye: A Solution for Enterprise Brands\n",
       "\n",
       "StreamEye emerges as a powerful platform designed specifically to meet the needs of enterprise brands looking to scale their digital asset production while maintaining quality. By integrating automation, customization, and collaboration features, StreamEye offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by marketers.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Automation Capabilities\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the standout features of StreamEye is its automation capabilities. The platform allows users to automate repetitive tasks such as resizing images or generating social media posts. This not only saves time but also frees up creative teams to focus on more strategic and innovative work [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "For instance, with StreamEye's automation tools, marketers can quickly generate multiple versions of an image for different platforms without manual intervention. This efficiency ensures that content is delivered on time while maintaining high standards.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Customization Options\n",
       "\n",
       "Customization is another area where StreamEye excels. The platform provides users with the ability to create custom templates and workflows tailored to their specific needs. Whether it's designing a unique layout for social media posts or setting up a workflow for video production, StreamEye ensures that every asset produced aligns perfectly with brand guidelines.\n",
       "\n",
       "This level of customization not only enhances consistency but also allows brands to adapt quickly to changing market demands. By having control over templates and workflows, teams can iterate rapidly on new offers and campaigns without compromising on quality. This aligns with StreamEye's unique proposition of \"Own Your Brand.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "### Collaboration Benefits\n",
       "\n",
       "Effective collaboration is crucial for any successful marketing team. StreamEye facilitates seamless teamwork by allowing multiple stakeholders to review and approve content in real-time. This feature reduces the risk of errors and miscommunication, ensuring that everyone is aligned with the brand's vision [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, a marketing team can collaborate on a video project where different members handle scriptwriting, design, and editing. StreamEye's collaborative platform ensures that all changes are tracked, feedback is incorporated efficiently, and the final product meets high-quality standards. This adaptability reflects StreamEye's commitment to being a \"Platform That Follows You.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "## A Real-World Success Story: LiveScore\n",
       "\n",
       "To illustrate how StreamEye makes a difference, let's look at the case of LiveScore, a leading sports media company. LiveScore uses StreamEye to produce high-volume, high-quality digital assets for their global audience. With StreamEye, they automate the creation of social media posts, resize images for different channels, and ensure brand consistency across all content [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "This partnership has enabled LiveScore to streamline their production process, reduce manual errors, and deliver engaging content on time. Notably, LiveScore reported a 30% increase in content output and a 25% reduction in production time after implementing StreamEye. Their success story highlights how StreamEye can transform an organization's digital asset production capabilities.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Ensuring Quality Control\n",
       "\n",
       "Maintaining quality is paramount in any digital asset production process. StreamEye addresses this through its Approvals feature, which enforces teams to publish only approved content by a designated party within the organization. This ensures that all assets meet the required standards before publication, particularly crucial for regulated markets [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "By integrating quality control into the workflow, StreamEye helps brands maintain their reputation and deliver consistent experiences to their audience. This feature is especially beneficial for industries where compliance is critical, ensuring that all marketing materials adhere to necessary regulations.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion: Elevate Your Digital Asset Production\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, mass-producing digital assets at scale is no longer a challenge but an opportunity for enterprise brands. With the right tools like StreamEye, brands can automate repetitive tasks, customize workflows, collaborate seamlessly, and ensure quality control throughout the production process.\n",

A staggering 70% of marketers report that creating content is their biggest challenge, highlighting the need for efficient solutions. Whether it\\'s creating multiple versions of images for different social media platforms or generating unique videos for marketing campaigns, the demand for efficient and consistent content creation has never been higher. However, achieving this without compromising on quality can be a daunting task.\\n\\nThis article explores how enterprise brands can overcome these challenges by leveraging advanced tools like StreamEye, which not only streamlines the production process but also ensures that creativity and quality remain at the forefront.\\n\\n## The Challenge of Mass-Producing Digital Assets\\n\\nBefore diving into solutions, it\\'s essential to understand what mass-producing digital assets entails. According to marketing experts, this refers to efficiently creating and distributing a high volume of content in various formats and sizes for different channels and platforms [1]. This can include resizing images for social media or email marketing, as well as producing unique assets like short-form videos for TikTok or Instagram Reels.\\n\\nEnterprise brands often face several pain points when trying to produce digital assets at scale:\\n\\n- **Time-Consuming Manual Processes**: Manually creating and editing each asset is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As one industry expert noted, \"The manual process can drain resources and slow down campaigns.\"\\n- **Lack of Resources**: Small teams or limited budgets can hinder the production of high-quality content at the required volume.\\n- **Inconsistent Branding**: Without a centralized system, maintaining brand consistency across all channels becomes challenging [2].\\n- **Difficulty in Scaling Creative Work**: As businesses grow, their creative needs expand, but internal teams may not be equipped to handle increased demand.\\n\\nThese challenges can lead to delayed campaigns, reduced brand consistency, and decreased customer engagement. To address these issues effectively, brands need a robust solution that combines automation, customization, and seamless collaboration.\\n\\n## StreamEye: A Solution for Enterprise Brands\\n\\nStreamEye emerges as a powerful platform designed specifically to meet the needs of enterprise brands looking to scale their digital asset production while maintaining quality. By integrating automation, customization, and collaboration features, StreamEye offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by marketers.\\n\\n### Automation Capabilities\\n\\nOne of the standout features of StreamEye is its automation capabilities. The platform allows users to automate repetitive tasks such as resizing images or generating social media posts. This not only saves time but also frees up creative teams to focus on more strategic and innovative work [3].\\n\\nFor instance, with StreamEye\\'s automation tools, marketers can quickly generate multiple versions of an image for different platforms without manual intervention. This efficiency ensures that content is delivered on time while maintaining high standards.\\n\\n### Customization Options\\n\\nCustomization is another area where StreamEye excels. The platform provides users with the ability to create custom templates and workflows tailored to their specific needs. Whether it\\'s designing a unique layout for social media posts or setting up a workflow for video production, StreamEye ensures that every asset produced aligns perfectly with brand guidelines.\\n\\nThis level of customization not only enhances consistency but also allows brands to adapt quickly to changing market demands. By having control over templates and workflows, teams can iterate rapidly on new offers and campaigns without compromising on quality. This aligns with StreamEye\\'s unique proposition of \"Own Your Brand.\"\\n\\n### Collaboration Benefits\\n\\nEffective collaboration is crucial for any successful marketing team. StreamEye facilitates seamless teamwork by allowing multiple stakeholders to review and approve content in real-time. This feature reduces the risk of errors and miscommunication, ensuring that everyone is aligned with the brand\\'s vision [3].\\n\\nFor example, a marketing team can collaborate on a video project where different members handle scriptwriting, design, and editing. StreamEye\\'s collaborative platform ensures that all changes are tracked, feedback is incorporated efficiently, and the final product meets high-quality standards. This adaptability reflects StreamEye\\'s commitment to being a \"Platform That Follows You.\"\\n\\n## A Real-World Success Story: LiveScore\\n\\nTo illustrate how StreamEye makes a difference, let\\'s look at the case of LiveScore, a leading sports media company. LiveScore uses StreamEye to produce high-volume, high-quality digital assets for their global audience.

Notably, LiveScore reported a 30% increase in content output and a 25% reduction in production time after implementing StreamEye. Their success story highlights how StreamEye can transform an organization\\'s digital asset production capabilities.\\n\\n## Ensuring Quality Control\\n\\nMaintaining quality is paramount in any digital asset production process. StreamEye addresses this through its Approvals feature, which enforces teams to publish only approved content by a designated party within the organization. This ensures that all assets meet the required standards before publication, particularly crucial for regulated markets [3].\\n\\nBy integrating quality control into the workflow, StreamEye helps brands maintain their reputation and deliver consistent experiences to their audience. This feature is especially beneficial for industries where compliance is critical, ensuring that all marketing materials adhere to necessary regulations.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Elevate Your Digital Asset Production\\n\\nIn conclusion, mass-producing digital assets at scale is no longer a challenge but an opportunity for enterprise brands.
